IMPORTANT
STEPS TO SPEED STUDENT PRODUCT FLOW
(For Supervisors and Tech Product Officers—
an LRH Despatch to Flag D of T)
If you consider each student who is tearing along successfully as an F/Ning
student, you would check anything that slowed the F/N.
Using dope-off as the detection of misunderstoods is running at a below F/N
level.
So if you consider that each student who is not 5.0 during study has a misunder-
stood WORD (not phrase or idea or concept) you could drive up velocity. Like auditing
by slowed F/N instead of TA rise.
An estimation of tone level of the current students shows them at about + or 2.5.
A very tight meter.
This could be remedied.
If I had this problem and a group of students at 2.5 I might approach it this way:
Put a meter on the desk. Use “I am not auditing you” so not to in-session them
and start with the faster students. I would check “In your study have you encountered
any word you did not fully understand?” If I got a read I’d send them to make up a list
from the first P/L or tape and LOOK THEM UP and USE THEM IN SENTENCES
and take the next one. Any real BIs, I’d send directly to a Word Clearing session.
I’d work on them until all their language was ironed out. Then I’d push this back
to a first few days action on the new ones—when I had the old ones handled.
Now possibly this is in to some degree.
5,235 (points per week) is of course high. There are however lows that take it
down. By eliminating these as slows, this average would rise.
These are not orders. They are organization steps to speed product flow—which
can be done without shattering stops such as “all students to TRs.”
Quality would rise as well as speed.
