2.
A.
Use only the small falls or falls or BDs. The rises will however show where mass lies.
If A or any of the A Group, and the pc has had an Int RD, do an Int RD Correction List, and
handle the reads. (HCO B 29 Oct 71 Amended 31 Dec 71.)
If pc has never had an Int RD, then give him a standard Int RD providing you have checked out
on the Int-Ext pack and are good at R3R.

1.
J.
If any of these read, do an L4B on the earliest lists you can find that have not been corrected.
Lacking these do an L4B in general. You can go over an L4B several times handling each read to
F/N until the whole L4B gives nothing but F/Ns.
If any of these, handle with 2wc and earlier similar to F/N. If more than one reads do biggest
read first and then clean up each of the others E/S to F/N. If all read on assessment you have to
get an F/N for each or 18 F/Ns. On overts and withholds, get what, and E/S to F/N. On out
ruds, find which rud and handle. (See GF40RR HCOB 30 June 71, Revised 13 Jan 72.) Feel sad,
handle the ARC Break. (Feel sad = ARC Brk of long duration.)
Rehab releases on each “drug” taken to F/N. Complete the Drug RD per C/S Series 48R after
handling all reads on this assessment. If pc has had a Drug RD, do L3B on it, and handle.
If any of these, do L3B and handle according to what is stated to do on L3B.
Clean up any protest and inval and rehab to F/N.
Find out what it is. If Yoga or Mystic exercises or some such 2wc E/S it to first time done, find
out what upset had occurred before that and if TA now down do L1C on that period of pc’s life.
If Word Clearing, do a Word Clearing Correction List, handle all reads. If Study errors, 2wc E/S
to F/N, and add a Study Correction List to the pc’s program.
False TA is wrong cans. Use HCO Bs 24 Oct 71, 12 Nov 71, 15 Feb 72, 18 Feb 72, 29 Feb
72, HCO B 23 Nov 73, all on False TA. Then clean up the bypassed charge with ( 1 ) Assess
for best read (a) TA worries (b) F/N worries. (2) Then 2wc times he was worried about (item)
E/S to F/N. (3) Rehab a time he felt really keyed out to F/N.
These are auditor errors. Low TA is generally caused by overwhelming TRs and incomplete
actions. A high TA can be caused by an auditor overrunning F/Ns or failing to call them. Or
trying to assess through an F/N and mistaking an F/N right swing for a read. These items are all
2wc E/S to F/N. Auditors who made them need Cramming badly or retread.
K.
 Can’t have or Hav. Find correct Havingness process and remedy.
L.
 PTS or Suppressed. Check for SP or get a full PTS RD.
M.
 Find out what. Clean up any protest. Rehab to F/N on each (or date to blow, locate to blow if
qualified).
N.
 2wc to find what. Note BD item. If BD item covered by one of these categories handle per
instructions. If not just 2wc to F/N and get further C/S instructions for handling if necessary.
O.
 Get pc to tell you about it briefly. If correct then indicate to F/N. Go E/S and indicate if no F/N
on first. If false TA handle per I above.
General. Handle Int RD (A) if it reads at all before handling rest as nothing will go right if Int is still
out. For the remainder prefer to handle any BD group if you get a BD. If in doubt about what to do,
return to the C/S.
