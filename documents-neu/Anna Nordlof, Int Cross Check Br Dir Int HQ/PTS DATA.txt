PTS/SP Checksheet
(Revisions in this type style)
PTS DATA
Based on a recent pilot it has become quite obvious that a full and complete PTS
handling would consist of:
A.
PTSness handled terminatedly by interview or auditing by a person trained
on BPL 31 May 71RF.
B.
Complete study and pass on the PTS/SP Checksheet, BPL 31 May 71RF
Re-Revised 4 Mar 77.
The correctly located suppressive, who is then handled based on a thorough
understanding of the mechanics of PTS/SP phenomena form the simplicity that is PTS
tech. The tech of locating the suppressive source is also fully covered in the PTS/SP
Checksheet and is a vital prerequisite for PTS handlers.
