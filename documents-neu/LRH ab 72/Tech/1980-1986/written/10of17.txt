    PREGNANCY AND AUDITING


Pregnant mothers are not to be audited or audit, for the
sixth month on up, on Power and up on the Grade Chart.

It is very common for pregnant mothers to be audited and to
audit on Dianetics and is in fact vital.

IMPORTANT NOTE: DIANETICS IS FORBIDDEN ON CLEARS, OTs AND 
DIANETIC CLEARS, PER HCOB 12 SEPT. 78R, DIANETICS FORBIDDEN 
ON CLEARS AND OTs.


There is a tremendous amount that can be done mentally and
spiritually by an auditor to assist someone who is sick or
hurt. We have known for years in Dianetics and Scientology
that the tech of assists is very powerful and can work
miracles when correctly applied.

The purpose of this bulletin is to lay out the available
technology on assists for handling the ill or injured.

The processes presented in this issue are in checklist
form, which will greatly aid the C/S and auditor in drawing
up and executing a proper assist program.


  USING THE CHECKLISTS

In 1974 I developed the system of using a preliminary
assessment of the pc's condition and checklists as aids to
programing and C/Sing the case.

Attached to this bulletin are separate checklists which
list symptoms for both injuries and illnesses and
corresponding handling sheets which list out the many
assist actions and their references one uses to handle either.

To use a checklist:

1. Look up the symptom or symptoms the pc may have on the
appropriate preliminary assessment sheet (injury or illness). 
Below each symptom are listed many possible handlings.

2. Look up the handlings on the appropriate handling sheet.

3. Use these handlings and their references in C/Sing and
programing the case.

4. Draw up the program and C/S.

5. The C/S can then circle the actions to be done on the
handling sheet and number them in sequence. The handling
sheet can be kept in the folder and signed off as each step
is done.

6. Audit the pc regularly until the illness, injury or
condition is handled.


  C/Sing AND PROGRAMING

The Assist Summary bulletins were never intended to be used
as a rote sequence of handling assists, which vary based on
the circumstances of the pc.

It could be a serious mistake to simply robotically copy
down in order the handlings listed for the pc's symptoms
and then audit them on the pc.

One reason for this is that the case levels of people
differ. An OT with a sprained ankle would be handled
differently than a Dianetic pc with one.

Also, injuries and illnesses are two separate subjects and
are handled differently.

Therefore, data has to be gotten where available, from
medical reports, session reports, interviews and exam
statements, and the C/S has to understand the case before
him and program and C/S accordingly.

ANY ASSIST ACTION MUST BE SUITED TO THAT PC'S CASE AND
CURRENT CONDITION.


  CAUTION

The injured or ill person is overwhelmed easily. One must
beware of keying the person in.

The operating basis is to take it easy on the pc and try
not to run anything too heavy on him. Going earlier-similar
on two-way comms should be avoided as due to his condition
E/S tends to make the ill or injured pc dive back to the
year zero. This is more than a sick person can stand up to.

Along with this, NEVER MISS AN F/N ON A SICK PERSON.


  NOTE ON HIGH-CRIMING REFERENCES

It well behooves any auditor or C/S to get his high-crime
checkouts in PT for the assist actions listed in this
bulletin. The circumstances requiring assists often crop up
unexpectedly and a well-prepared auditor will be more
successful than an unprepared one.

One would always do whatever one could to help a person in
difficulty regardless. Still, it is a matter of technical 
integrity and professional pride that one would get his 
high-crime checkouts in PT for assist actions to his class.

___________

Factually, there is no group but ourselves which possesses
a body of technology to effectively assist the spiritual
condition of the ill or injured person. Our knowledge in
this area is considerable.

So don't skimp on your study and drilling of these
procedures and the theory behind them. You can do much to
relieve the misery suffered by the ill or injured.

With full understanding and application of assists you may
appear to others to be a miracle worker.

==================
077. Attachment #2 HANDLING SHEET FOR INJURIES


HCOB 29.7.81R

ATTACHMENT #2


    HANDLING SHEET FOR INJURIES


1. FIRST AID AND ENVIRONMENTAL CONTROL

Where you are giving an assist to one person, you put
things in the environment into an orderly state as the
first step, unless you are trying to stop a pumping
artery-but here you would use first aid. You should
understand that first aid always precedes an assist. You
should look the situation over from the standpoint of how 
much first aid is required.

You may often have to find some method of controlling,
handling and directing personnel who get in your way before
you can render an assist. You might just as well realize
that an assist requires that you control the entire
environment and personnel associated with the assist if
necessary.

A good example of an assist would be when somebody is
washing dishes in the kitchen. There is a horrendous crash
and the person comes down all over the sink, hits the
floor; as she is going down, she grabs the butcher knife as
it falls.

You go in and say, "Well, let me fix that up." One of the
first things you would have to do is to wind some bandage
around the hand to stop the bleeding. Part of the first aid
would be to pick up the dishes and put them back on the
sink, sweep the pieces together into a more orderly
semblance. This is the first symptom of control. (Ref: HCOB
21 Oct. 71, ASSISTS IN SCIENTOLOGY)

(This could include getting some assistance to ease
discomfort, such as Epsom-salt baths, liniment, changing
bandages, etc.)


2. MEDlCAL TREATMENT

An assist is not a substitute for medical attention and
does not attempt to cure injuries requiring medical aid.
First, call the doctor. Then assist the person as you can.
(Ref: Ability 73, "Assists in Scientology")

Medical examination and diagnosis should be sought where
needed, and where treatment is routinely successful,
medical treatment should be obtained. As an assist can at
times cover up an actual injury or broken bone, no chances
should be taken, especially if the condition does not
easily respond. In other words, where something is merely
thought to be a slight sprain, to be on the safe side an
X-ray should be obtained, particularly if it does not at
once respond. An assist is not a substitute for medical
treatment but is complementary to it. It is even doubtful
if full healing can be accomplished by medical treatment
alone and it is certain that an assist greatly speeds
recovery. In short, one should realize that physical
healing does not take into account the being and the
repercussion on the spiritual beingness of the person.
(Ref: HCOB 11 July 73RB, ASSIST SUMMARY)


3. lF A PERSON HAS DONE A BUNK

The preclear may do a compulsive exteriorization, "do a
bunk," and drop his body limp in the chair and give from
that body no sign that he is hearing any of the auditing
commands given by the auditor. One such case was pleaded
with for half an hour by an auditor along the lines that
the preclear should remember her husband, should think of
her children, should come back and live for the 
sake of her friends, and found no response from the
preclear. Finally the auditor said, "Think of your poor
auditor," at which moment the preclear promptly returned.
(Ref: Dianetics 55! Chapter XVI, "Exteriorization")


4. UNCONSClOUS OR IN A COMA

"YOU MAKE THAT BODY SIT ON THAT CHAIR." (or "LIE ON THAT
BED.") (Ref: Tape: 5905C21 Clearing, Processes-Special Cases)


5. UNCONSCIOUS OR IN A COMA

Touch patient's hand to parts of the bed with "FEEL THAT
(object)." (Ref: HCOB 27 July 69, ANTIBIOTICS)


6. UNCONSCIOUS OR IN A COMA

An unconscious pc can be audited off a meter by taking his
hand and having him touch nearby things like pillow, floor,
etc., or body without hurting an injured part. A person in
a coma for months can be brought around by doing this daily.
(Ref: HCOB 5 July 71RB, C/S Series 49RB, ASSISTS)


7. SHOCK OR CATATONIA

"HERE. WHAT WORD DID I SAY TO YOU?" "HERE. WHAT WORD DID I
SAY TO YOU?" The auditor keeps this up until all of a
sudden the pc says, "You said 'Here.' " Then, "REACH DOWN
NOW AND FIND THE FLOOR WITH YOUR HAND. PRESS IT." 
(Ref: Tape: 5406C17 "Assists")


8. CONTACT ASSIST

Where possible and where indicated, until the person has
reestablished his communication with the physical universe
site. To F/N. (Ref: HCOB 11 July 73RB, ASSIST SUMMARY; HCOB
5 July 71RB, C/S Series 49RB, ASSISTS; HCOB 2 Apr. 69RA, 
DIANETIC ASSISTS)


9. TOUCH ASSIST

Until the person has reestablished communication with the
physical part or parts affected. To F/N. (Ref: HCOB 11 July
73RB, ASSIST SUMMARY; HCOB 21 Oct. 71, ASSISTS IN SCIENTOLOGY; 
HCOB 7 Apr. 72RA, TOUCH ASSISTS, CORRECT ONES)


10. HAVINGNESS

Running HAVINGNESS in every assist session is vital. This
not only remedies havingness but also brings the preclear
to present time. (Ref: HCOB 11 July 73RB, ASSIST SUMMARY;
HCOB 7 Aug. 78, HAVINGNESS FINDING AND RUNNING THE PC'S 
HAVINGNESS PE2OCESS; HCOB 6 Oct. 60R, THIRTY-SIX NEW PRESESSIONS)


11. REACH AND WITHDRAW

Run Reach and Withdraw from the affected area. (Ref: HCOB
24 July 69R, SERIOUSLY ILL PCs)

Reach and Withdraw can also be done on other body parts not
affected, the environment, the body itself, the location
where an injury occurred, the thing that injured the pc
(e.g., the knife that cut him). To EP of F/N, GIs. (Ref:
HCOB 10 April 81R, REACH AND WITHDRAW)


12. HELLO AND OK

"HELLO" AND "OKAY." (Ref: PAB 123, THE REALITY SCALE)


13. WHERE DID IT HAPPEN?

"WHERE DID IT HAPPEN?" "WHERE ARE YOU NOW?" (Ref: Ability 110,
TECHNIQUES OF CHILD PROCESSING)


14. COMMUNICATION

"FROM WHERE COULD YOU COMMUNICATE TO A (body part)?" To
F/N, Cog, VGIs. (Ref: HCOB 25 Sept. 59, HAS COAUDIT)


15. LOOK AT THAT______

"LOOK AT THAT (object)." "DECIDE THE INJURY CANNOT HAVE IT."
EP: Pain gone, cog, F/N. (Ref: Ability 73, ASSISTS IN SCIENTOLOGY)


16. KEEP IT FROM GOING AWAY

"KEEP IT FROM GOING AWAY." (Ref: Ability 73, ASSISTS IN
SCIENTOLOGY)


17. INJURY (IMPACT)

"WHERE AREN'T YOU BEING _____ (e.g., 'hit')?" Making sure he gets
these places with great certainty. As a result you will get
yourself quite a reduction in case. (Run to F/N, Cog,
VGIs.) (Ref: Tape: 5406C17, "Assists") 


18. PURPOSE

Ask the pc, "GIVE ME ANOTHER PURPOSE FOR A (e.g., bad ear)." He
already assumes he's given you one. He's got a bad ear. You
could ask him for a few more purposes. Have him dream up a
few more purposes and he'll feel much better. 
(Ref: Tape: 5608C "Chronic Somatics")


19. RUDIMENTS

Fly rudiments as follows:

HANDLE ANY ARC BREAK that might have existed at the time
(a) with the environment, (b) with another, (c) with others, 
(d) with himself, (e) with the body part or the body and 
(f) with any failure to recover at once. Each to F/N.

HANDLE ANY PROBLEM the person may have had (a) at the time
of illness or injury, (b) subsequently due to his or her 
condition. Each to F/N.

HANDLE ANY WITHHOLD (a) the person might have had at the
time, (b) any subsequent withhold and (c) any having to 
withhold the body from work or others or the environment 
due to being physically unable to approach it. 
(Ref: HCOB 11 July 73RB, ASSIST SUMMARY)


20. L1C

L1C "CONCERNING THE ILLNESS______" or "CONCERNING THE
INJURY/ACCIDENT______." Can also do LlC on the injured
member. (Ref: HCOB 23 July 71R, ASSISTS)


21. NARRATIVE R3RA

RUN THE INCIDENT ITSELF Narrative R3RA Quad to erasure and full EP.

Interest is checked. It is understood here that Flow 1 was
the physical incident itself, not necessarily something
done to the person but as something that happened to him or
her. (Ref: HCOB 26 June 78RA II, NED Series 6RA,
ROUTINE 3RA ENGRAM RUNNING BY CHAINS; HCOB 28 July 71RB,
C/S Series 54RB, NED Series 8RA, DIANETICS, BEGINNING A PC ON)
Note: Dianetics is not run on Clears or OTs.


22. DATE/LOCATE

DATE/LOCATE THE INJURY. (Ref: HCOB 15 Nov. 78, DATING AND
LOCATING)


23. SECONDARY

HANDLE ANY SECONDARY, which is to say emotional reactions, 
stresses or shocks before, during or after the situation. 
Narrative Secondaries are run R3RA Narrative Quad. Interest 
is checked. It is important to get the earliest beginning of
the incident and to continue to check for earlier beginning
each run through.

(Ref: HCOB 26 June 78RA II, NED Series 6RA, ROUTINE 3RA ENGRAM
RUNNING BY CHAINS; HCOB 28 June 78RA, NED Series 7RA, R3RA
COMMANDS; HCOB 28 July 71RB, C/S Series 54RB, NED Series 8RA,
DIANETICS, BEGINNING A PC ON; HCOB 11 July 73RB, ASSIST
SUMMARY) Note: Dianetics is not run on Clears or OTs.


24. PREASSESSMENT

PREASSESS THE INCIDENT and take to a full Dianetic EP all somatics
connected with the incident in which the pc is interested.
(Ref: HCOB 18 June 78R, NED Series 4R, ASSESSMENT AND HOW
TO GET THE ITEM, and the issues referenced in 23 above) 
Note: Dianetics is not run on Clears or OTs.


25. L3RH

Check if the area was audited before on R3RA. If so, L3RH
to F/N list on it. (Ref: HCOB 11 April 71RE, NED Series 20, 
L3RH, DIANETICS AND INT RD REPAIR LIST)


26. SERVICE FACSIMILE

If pc has a service fac or evil purpose behind it, R3RA
Quad. (Ref: HCOB 22 June 78RA, NED Series 2RA, NEW ERA
DIANETICS FULL PC PROGRAM OUTLINE.) Note: Dianetics is not 
run on Clears and OTs.


27. POSTULATE TWO-WAY COMM

POSTULATE TWO-WAY COMM. To F/N. Not E/S. (Ref: HCOB 11 July
73RB, ASSIST SUMMARY)


28. PRIOR CONFUSION TWO-WAY COMM

By two-way comm see if a confusion existed prior to the
accident, injury or illness. To F/N. Not E/S. (Ref: HCOB 11
July 73RB, ASSIST SUMMARY)


29. MYSTERY POINT

Two-way comm any mysterious aspect of the incident to F/N
Cog VGIs. Not E/S. (Ref: HCOB 11 July 73RB, ASSIST SUMMARY)


30. TWO-WAY COMM AGREEMENT

Get any agreement the person may have had in or with the
incident. Not E/S. (Ref: HCOB 11 July 73RB, ASSIST SUMMARY)


31. PROTEST

Two-way comm any protest in the incident. Not E/S. (Ref:
HCOB 11 July 73RB, ASSIST SUMMARY)


32. PREDICTION

Two-way comm (a) how long he/she expects to take to
recover, (b) get the person to tell you any predictions
others have made about it. Two-way comm it to an F/N Cog
VGIs. (Ref: HCOB 11 July 73RB, ASSIST SUMMARY)


33. FIXED PICTURE (BEFORE/AFTER)

Where an injured or ill pc is so stuck that he has a fixed
picture that does not move, one can jar it loose by asking
him to recall a time before the incident and then asking
him to recall a time after it. This will "jar the engram
loose" and change the stuck point. (Ref: HCOB 11 July 73RB,
ASSIST SUMMARY)


34. SOMETHING/NOTHING

Have the numb, painful or injured area say, "THERE IS
SOMETHING HERE, THERE IS NOTHING HERE," having it then 
say, "THERE IS SOMETHING THERE, THERE IS NOTHING THERE," 
having the preclear say about the area, "THERE IS SOMETHING 
THERE, THERE IS NOTHING THERE," and then the preclear about 
himself, "THERE IS SOMETHING HERE, THERE IS NOTHING HERE." 
This makes a complete bracket. Run to pain gone, cog, F/N.
(Ref: The Journal of Scientology 16-G, THIS IS SCIENTOLOGY, THE
SCIENCE OF CERTAINTY)


35. INJURED AND WAS IN A SMALL ROOM FOR A LONG TIME

The gradient scale of taking people into larger and larger
spaces was an early one. An individual has been lying in
this small room. He's very ill. He's been lying in this
small room for days and days and weeks and weeks and you're
going to process him. Just get him into a little bit larger
space. The tremendous tiredness he will experience is just
giving him a little more space and a greater remoteness of
wall. You take him out of his room into a larger room, he
will start to experience tiredness. If you did that every
day and you gave him a little more space every day and
gradiently scaled him up the line a little bit more and a
little bit more, the individual would snap out of it. It's
quite interesting because what you're doing is giving him a
gradient scale of larger spaces to confront. Just don't
give it to him with such steep doses that he finds them
unconfrontable and you've got it made. (Ref: Tape: 5904C28
"Theory of Processes")


36. WAS AUDITED WHILE ON DRUGS

Where a person is injured, given a Contact or Touch Assist
and then medical examination and treatment, he is given the
remainder as soon as he is able to be audited. The drug
"five days" does not need to apply. But where the person
has been given an assist over drugs, one must later come
back to the case when he is off drugs and run the drug part
out or at least make sure that nothing was submerged by the
drugs. It is not uncommon for a person to be oblivious to
certain parts of a treatment or operation at the time of
initial auditing, only to have a missing piece of the
incident pop up days, months or even years later.

THIS is the reason injuries or operations occasionally seem
to persist despite a full assist: A piece of it was left
unhandled due to a drugged condition during the operation;
such bits may come off unexpectedly in routine auditing on
some other apparently disrelated chain. (Ref: HCOB 11 July
73RB, ASSIST SUMMARY; HCOB 15 July 71RD III, C/S Series 48RE, 
NED Series 9RC, DRUG HANDLING; and HCOB 19 May 69RB, DRUG AND 
ALCOHOL CASES-PRIOR ASSESSING)


37. SPOT THE SPOT

"SPOT THE SPOT WHERE THE ACCIDENT OCCURRED," "SPOT A SPOT
IN THE ROOM." Run alternate-repetitive. (Ref: 5410C13,
"Retraining Unit: The Assist")


38. RUDIMENTS BEFORE THE INJURY

Fly ruds before the illness or injury. (Can be done Quad.)
(Ref: HCOB 24 July 69R, SERIOUSLY ILL PCS)


39. PREPCHECK PRIOR CONFUSION

PREPCHECK THE PRIOR CONFUSION TO THE ILLNESS OR THE
ACCIDENT/INJURY. Note: Do not prepcheck the illness itself
or accident/injury itself. (Ref: HCOB 9 Nov. 61, THE 
PROBLEMS INTENSIVE-USE OF THE PRIOR CONFUSION; 
HCOB 7 Sept. 78R, MODERN REPETITIVE PREPCHECKING. 
Also, Tape: 6110C03, "The Prior Confusion")


40. PTS C/S-1

The PTS C/S-1, given in HCOB 31 Dec. 78RA III, EDUCATING THE
POTENTIAL TROUBLE SOURCE, THE FIRST STEP TOWARD HANDLING: 
PTS C/S-l, must be done before any other PTS handling is begun.
(Ref: HCOB 31 Dec. 78RA II, OUTLINE OF PTS HANDLING)


41. SUPPRESSIVE PRESENCE

Two-way comm any suppressive or invalidative presence that
may have caused a mistake to be made or the accident to
occur. To F/N Cog VGIs. Not E/S. (Ref: HCOB 11 July 73RB,
ASSIST SUMMARY)


42. PTS INTERVIEW

A metered PTS interview per HCOB 24 Apr. 72 I, C/S Series 79, PTS
INTERVIEWS, or a "10 August Handling" per HCOB 10 Aug. 73, PTS
HANDLING, done by an auditor in session or an MAA, D of P
or SSO will, in most cases, assist the person to spot the
antagonistic or SP element. Once spotted, the potential
trouble source can be assisted in working out a handling
for that terminal. (Ref: HCOB 31 Dec. 78RA II, OUTLINE OF PTS
HANDLING)


43. S&Ds

Three S&Ds per HCOB 16 Aug. 69R, HANDLING ILLNESS IN
SCIENTOLOGY.


44. RUDIMENTS ON ANTAGONISTIC TERMINAL

RUDIMENTS. Flying ruds and overts triple or quad flow on
the antagonistic terminal is often done to "get ruds in"
and enable the pc to better confront the PTS situation he
is faced with. This would, of course, be done only in
session by a qualified auditor when so ordered by the Case
Supervisor. (Ref: HCOB 31 Dec. 78RA II, OUTLINE OF PTS
HANDLING)


45. UNRESOLVED PAINS

Where you can't fully repair a crippled left leg, don't be
surprised to find it was the right leg that was hurt. You
audit the left leg somatic in vain. If you do, start
auditing somatics in the OPPOSITE SIDE OF THE BODY. This is
also true for toothaches. Look at the pc's mouth. Has the 
RIGHT upper molar ever been pulled or injured? Yes. That's 
how the left molar began to decay. The right upper molar was
pulled. The pain (especially under the painkiller on the
right side only) backed up and stopped on the opposite
side. Eventually, the left upper molar, under that stress,
a year or ten later, caves in and aches. (Ref: HCOB 15 July
70R, UNRESOLVED PAINS)


46. L&N, VERIFY/CORRECT

Check if any L&N done in connection with the area, verify
or correct the lists.

NOTHING PRODUCES AS MUCH CASE UPSET AS A WRONG LIST
ITEM OR A WRONG LIST. Nothing else produces such a sharp
deterioration in a case or even illness. (Ref: HCOB 
20 Apr. 72 II, C/S Series 78, PRODUCT PURPOSE AND WHY AND 
W/C ERROR CORRECTION)


47. NOTHING WORKING

"TELL ME SOMETHING WORSE THAN A (body part)" until it is no
longer a problem to the pc. (Ref: HCOB 23 Feb. 61, PT PROBLEM 
AND GOALS)


48. INJURY DURING/AFTER AUDITING

Repair the earlier auditing with the appropriate correction
list and/or GF M5 as soon as possible. It can occur that a
pc gets ill after being audited where the "auditing" is
out-tech. When this occurs or is suspected, a Green Form
should be assessed only by an auditor who can meter and
whose TR 1 gets reads. The GF reads are then handled.
Out-Interiorization, bad lists, missed W/Hs, ARC breaks and
incomplete or flubbed engrams are the commonest errors.
(Ref: HCOB 11 July 73RB, ASSIST SUMMARY)


49. INJURED CHILD

"WHERE DID IT HAPPEN?" "WHERE ARE YOU NOW?" (Ref: Ability 110,
TECHNIQUES OF CHILD PROCESSING)


50. CHILD WITH PHYSICAL DEFECT OR PSYCHOSOMATIC ILL

"FEEL MY ARM," "THANK YOU," "FEEL YOUR ARM," "THANK YOU"
and so on, using common body parts. (Ref: Ability 110,
TECHNIQUES OF CHILD PROCESSING)


51. HIGH OR LOW TA

A C/S 53RL should be used to get the TA under control
during assists if it cannot be gotten down. It must be done
by an auditor who knows how to meter and can get reads.
(Ref: HCOB 11 July 73RB, ASSIST SUMMARY) Note:

Additional references applicable to this situation are HCOB
10 Dec. 76RB, C/S Series 99RB, SCIENTOLOGY F/N AND TA
POSITION, and HCOB 2 Dec. 80, FLOATING NEEDLE AND TA 
POSITION MODIFIED.)


52. INJURED AND IN NO-INTERFERENCE AREA

Assess and handle the correction list for the Advanced
Course level he is on or just completed as soon as
possible. (Ref: HCOB 23 Dec. 71RB, Solo C/S Series 10RB,
C/S Series 73RB, THE NO-INTERFERENCE AREA- CLARIFIED
AND REINFORCED)


53. ACCIDENT PRONE

Run a full battery of Objectives (CCHs, SCS, SOP 8-C, Op
Pro by Dup, etc.) or put the person through the TRs and
Objectives Co-audit Course. (Ref: HCOB 12 June 70, C/S
Series 2, PROGRAMING OF CASES)


54. TIREDNESS

Do a purpose list as follows: WHAT PURPOSE HAS BEEN BLUNTED? 
You can also use "abandoned" if it reads better. Tiredness is
technically BLUNTED PURPOSE. The most effective way to
handle this is by overt-motivator engram. (Ref: HCOB 8 Sept. 
71R, CASE SUPERVISOR ACTIONS, HCOB 15 Sept. 68R, TIREDNESS)


55. PREGNANCY

A pregnant woman should have a full Preassessment done on
birth and babies before delivery. Immediately after
delivery, the incident itself should be run out Narrative
R3RA Quad and preassessed if necessary. (Ref: HCOB 15 Jan.
70, THE USES OF AUDITING; HCOB 11 July 73RB, ASSIST SUMMARY)

Note: Pregnant women are not to be audited or audit for the
sixth month on up, from Power on up the Grade Chart. It is
very common for pregnant mothers to be audited and to audit
on New Era Dianetics and is in fact vital. Note: Dianetics
is not run on Clears or OTs.

079. Attachment #4 HANDLING SHEET FOR ILLNESSES


HCOB 29.7.81R

ATTACHMENT #4


   HANDLING SHEET FOR ILLNESSES


A. MEDICAL TREATMENT

An assist is not a substitute for medical attention and
does not attempt to cure injuries requiring medical aid.
First, call the doctor. Then assist the person as you can.
(Ref: Ability 73, "Assists in Scientology")

Medical examination and diagnosis should be sought where
needed, and where treatment is routinely successful,
medical treatment should be obtained. As an assist can at
times cover up an actual injury or broken bone, no chances
should be taken, especially if the condition does not
easily respond. In other words, where something is merely
thought to be a slight sprain, to be on the safe side an
X-ray should be obtained, particularly if it does not at
once respond. An assist is not a substitute for medical
treatment but is complementary to it. It is even doubtful
if full healing can be accomplished by medical treatment
alone and it is certain that an assist greatly speeds
recovery. In short, one should realize that physical
healing does not take into account the being and the
repercussion on the spiritual beingness of the person.
(Ref: HCOB 11 July 73RB, ASSIST SUMMARY)


B. FIRST AID AND ENVMONMENTAL CONTROL

Where you are giving an assist to one person, you put
things in the environment into an orderly state as the
first step, unless you are trying to stop a pumping
artery-but here you would use first aid. You should
understand that first aid always precedes an assist. You
should look the situation over from the standpoint of how 
much first aid is required.

You may often have to find some method of controlling,
handling and directing personnel who get in your way before
you can render an assist. You might just as well realize
that an assist requires that you control the entire
environment and personnel associated with the assist if
necessary.

A good example of an assist would be when somebody is
washing dishes in the kitchen. There is a horrendous crash
and the person comes down all over the sink, hits the
floor; as she is going down, she grabs the butcher knife as
it falls.

You go in and say, "Well, let me fix that up." One of the
first things you would have to do is to wind some bandage
around the hand to stop the bleeding. Part of the first aid
would be to pick up the dishes and put them back on the
sink, sweep the pieces together into a more orderly
semblance. This is the first symptom of control. (Ref: HCOB
21 Oct. 71, ASSISTS IN SCIENTOLOGY)

(This could include getting some assistance to ease
discomfort, such as Epsom-salt baths, liniment, changing
bandages, etc.)


C. PERSON HAS DONE A BUNK

The preclear may do a compulsive exteriorization, "do a
bunk," and drop his body limp in the chair and give from
that body no sign that he is hearing any of the auditing
commands given by the auditor. One such case was pleaded
with for half an hour by an auditor along the lines that
the preclear should remember her husband, should think of
her children, should come back and live for the sake of her
friends, and found no response from the preclear. Finally
the auditor said, "Think of your poor auditor," at which
moment the preclear promptly returned. (Ref: Dianetics 55!
Chapter XVI, "Exteriorization")


D. UNCONSCIOUS OR IN A COMA

"YOU MAKE THAT BODY SIT ON THAT CHAIR." (or "LIE ON THAT
BED.") (Ref: Tape: 5905C21 "Clearing, Processes-Special Cases)


E. UNCONSCIOUS OR IN A COMA

Touch patient's hand to parts of the bed with "FEEL THAT
(object)." (Ref: HCOB 27 July 69, ANTIBIOTICS)


F. UNCONSCIOUS OR IN A COMA

An unconscious pc can be audited off a meter by taking his
hand and having him touch nearby things like pillow, floor,
etc., or body without hurting an injured part.

A person in a coma for months can be brought around by
doing this daily. (Ref: HCOB 5 July 71RB, C/S Series 49RB,
ASSISTS)


G. SHOCK OR CATATONIA

"HERE. WHAT WORD DID I SAY TO YOU?" "HERE. WHAT WORD DID I
SAY TO YOU?" The auditor keeps this up until all of a
sudden the pc says, "You said 'Here.' " Then, "REACH DOWN
NOW AND FIND THE FLOOR WITH YOUR HAND. PRESS IT." 
(Ref: Tape: 5406C17 "Assists")


H. CONTACT ASSIST

Where possible and where indicated, until the person has
reestablished his communication with the physical universe
site. To F/N. (Ref: HCOB 11 July 73RB, ASSIST SUMMARY; HCOB
5 July 71RB, C/S Series 49RB, ASSISTS; HCOB 2 Apr. 69RA, 
DIANETIC ASSISTS)


I . TOUCH ASSIST

Until the person has reestablished communication with the
physical part or parts affected. To F/N. (Ref: HCOB 11 July
73RB, ASSIST SUMMARY; HCOB 21 Oct. 71, ASSISTS IN SCIENTOLOGY; 
HCOB 7 Apr. 72RA, TOUCH ASSISTS, CORRECT ONES)


J. HAVINGNESS

Running HAVINGNESS in every assist session is vital. This
not only remedies havingness but also brings the preclear
to present time. (Ref: HCOB 11 July 73RB, ASSIST SUMMARY;
HCOB 7 Aug. 78, HAVINGNESS FINDING AND RUNNING THE PC'S 
HAVINGNESS PROCESS; HCOB 6 Oct. 60R, THIRTY-SIX NEW PRESESSIONS)


K. ATTENTION

He is explaining his illness by saying he needs attention
and he is using it as a service fac of some sort or
another, and you will find out this very often gives up if
you give him attention. Well, there are various ways to
give him attention. Get him a nurse, get him a doctor, put
him in a special room, put him on arduously, awfully hard
to maintain schedules.

You take a pink pill at twenty minutes after the hour,
three and one-half blue pills forty-five minutes past the
hour, and then every hour on the hour take seven green
ones, but skip every odd-numbered hour. Attention then is
given to it and he gets the idea it is being as-ised. This
makes him feel stronger and he will start to as-is it
himself and very often gets well simply by giving him
attention. There are various mechanisms to do so. (Ref:
Tape: 5905C21 "Clearing, Processes- Special Cases")


L. REACH AND WITHDRAW

Run Reach and Withdraw from the affected area. (Ref: HCOB

Reach and Withdraw can also be done on other body parts not
affected, the environment, the body itself, the location
where an injury occurred, the thing that injured the pc
(e.g., the knife that cut him). To EP of F/N, GIs. (Ref:

Where an injured or ill pc is so stuck that he has a fixed
picture that does not move, one can jar it loose by asking
him to recall a time before the incident and then asking
him to recall a time after it. This will "jar the engram
loose" and change the stuck point. (Ref: HCOB 11 July 73RB,

II. SOMETHING/NOTHING

Have the numb, painful or injured area say, "THERE IS
SOMETHING HERE, THERE IS NOTHING HERE," having it then say, 
"THERE IS SOMETHING THERE, THERE IS NOTHING THERE," having 
the preclear say about the area, "THERE IS SOMETHING THERE, 
THERE IS NOTHING THERE," and then the preclear about himself, 
"THERE IS SOMETHING HERE, THERE IS NOTHING HERE." This makes 
a complete bracket. Run to pain gone, cog, F/N.

SCIENCE OF CERTAINTY)


JJ. ILL AND WAS IN A SMALL ROOM FOR A LONG TIME

The gradient scale of taking people into larger and larger
spaces was an early one. An individual has been lying in
this small room. He's very ill. He's been lying in this
small room for days and days and weeks and weeks and you're
going to process him. Just get him into a little bit larger
space. The tremendous tiredness he will experience is just
giving him a little more space and a greater remoteness of
wall. You take him out of his room into a larger room, he
will start to experience tiredness. If you did that every
day and you gave him a little more space every day and
gradiently scaled him up the line a little bit more and a
little bit more, the individual would snap out of it. It's
quite interesting because what you're doing is giving him a
gradient scale of larger spaces to confront. Just don't
give it to him with such steep doses that he finds them
unconfrontable and you've got it made. (Ref: Tape: 5904C28
"Theory of Processes")


KK. RUDS BEFORE THE ILLNESS

Fly ruds before the illness or injury. (Can be done Quad.)
(Ref: HCOB 24 July 69R, SERIOUSLY ILL PCS)


LL. PREPCHECK PRIOR CONFUSION

PREPCHECK THE PRIOR CONFUSION TO THE ILLNESS OR THE
ACCIDENT/INJURY. Note : Do not prepcheck the illness itself or
accident/injury itself. (Ref: HCOB 9 Nov. 61, THE PROBLEMS
INTENSIVE-USE OF THE PRIOR CONFUSION; HCOB 7 Sept. 78R,
MODERN REPETITIVE PREPCHECKING. Also, Tape: 6110C03, "The Prior
Confusion")


MM. HIGH TEMPERATURE

When illness is accompanied by temperature, antibiotics is
usually the first thought. Then fly all ruds and do a
Temperature Assist, Version A or Version B.

NN. PTS C/S-I

The PTS C/S-1, given in HCOB 31 Dec. 78RA III, EDUCATING THE
POTENTIAL TROUBLE SOURCE, THE FIRST STEP TOWARD HANDLING: 
PTS C/S-1, must be done before any other PTS handling is begun.
(Ref: HCOB 31 Dec. 78RA II, OUTLINE OF PTS HANDLING)


OO. PTS INTERVIEW

A metered PTS interview per HCOB 24 Apr. 72 I, C/S Series 79, PTS
INTERVIEWS, or a "10 August Handling" per HCOB 10 Aug. 73, PTS
HANDLING, done by an auditor in session or an MAA, D of P
or SSO will, in most cases, assist the person to spot the
antagonistic or SP element. Once spotted, the potential
trouble source can be assisted in working out a handling
for that terminal. (Ref: HCOB 31 Dec. 78RA II, OUTLINE OF PTS
HANDLING)


PP. S&Ds

Three S&Ds per HCOB 16 Aug. 69R, HANDLING ILLNESS IN SCIENTOLOGY.


QQ. RUDIMENTS ON THE ANTAGONISTIC TERMINAL

Flying ruds and overts triple or quad flow on the
antagonistic terminal is often done to "get ruds in" and
enable the pc to better confront the PTS situation he is
faced with. This would, of course, be done only in session
by a qualified auditor when so ordered by the Case Supervisor. 
(Ref: HCOB 31 Dec. 78RA II, OUTLINE OF PTS HANDLING)


RR. UNRESOLVED PAINS

Where you can't fully repair a crippled left leg, don't be
surprised to find it was the right leg that was hurt. You
audit the left leg somatic in vain. If you do, start
auditing somatics in the OPPOSITE SIDE OF THE BODY.

This is also true for toothaches. Look at the pc's mouth.
Has the RIGHT upper molar ever been pulled or injured? Yes.
That's how the left molar began to decay. The right upper
molar was pulled. The pain (especially under the painkiller 
on the right side only) backed up and stopped on the opposite 
side. Eventually, the left upper molar, under that stress, a 
year or ten later, caves in and aches. (Ref: HCOB 15 July 70R,
UNRESOLVED PAINS)


SS. L&N, VERIFY/CORRECT

Check if any L&N done in connection with the area, verify
or correct the lists.

NOTHING PRODUCES AS MUCH CASE UPSET AS A WRONG LIST

ITEM OR A WRONG LIST. Nothing else produces such a sharp
deterioration in a case or even illness. (Ref: HCOB 
20 Apr. 72 II, C/S Series 78, PRODUCT PURPOSE AND WHY AND 
W/C ERROR CORRECTION)


TT. NOTHING WORKING

"TELL ME SOMETHING WORSE THAN A (body part)" until it is no
longer a problem to the pc. (Ref: HCOB 23 Feb 1961, PT PROBLEM 
AND GOALS)


UU. ILLNESS DURING/AFTER AUDITING

Repair the earlier auditing with the appropriate correction
list and/or GF M5 as soon as possible.

It can occur that a pc gets ill after being audited where
the "auditing" is out-tech.

When this occurs or is suspected, a Green Form should be
assessed only by an auditor who can meter and whose TR 1
gets reads. The GF reads are then handled. Out-Interiorization, 
bad lists, missed W/Hs, ARC breaks and incomplete or flubbed 
engrams are the commonest errors. 

(Ref: HCOB 11 July 73RB, ASSIST SUMMARY)


VV. CHILD WITH PHYSICAL DEFECT OR PSYCHOSOMATIC ILL

"FEEL MY ARM," "THANK YOU," "FEEL YOUR ARM," "THANK YOU,"
and so on, using common body parts. (Ref: Ability 110,
TECHNIQUES OF CHILD PROCESSING)


XX. HIGH OR LOW TA

A C/S 53RL should be used to get the TA under control
during assists if it cannot be gotten down. It must be done
by an auditor who knows how to meter and can get reads.
(Ref: HCOB 11 July 73RB, ASSIST SUMMARY) Note: Additional 
references applicable to this situation are HCOB 10 Dec. 76RB, 
C/S Series 99RB, SCIENTOLOGY F/N AND TA POSITION, and 
HCOB 2 Dec. 80, FLOATING NEEDLE AND TA POSITION MODIFIED. )


YY. ILL AND IN NO-INTERFERENCE AREA

Assess and handle the correction list for the Advanced
Course level he is on or just completed as soon as
possible. (Ref: HCOB 23 Dec. 71RB, Solo C/S Series 10RB,
C/S Series 73RB, THE NOINTERFERENCE AREA -CLARIFIED
AND REINFORCED)


ZZ. TIREDNESS

Do a purpose list as follows: WHAT PURPOSE HAS BEEN BLUNTED? 
You can also use "abandoned" if it reads better. Tiredness 
is technically BLUNTED PURPOSE. The most effective way to
handle this is by overtmotivator engram.

(Ref: HCOB 8 Sept. 71R, CASE SUPERVISOR ACTIONS, HCOB 15 Sept.
68R, TIREDNESS)


AAA. CHRONICALLY ILL

080. HCOB 15 SEP 81 THE CRIMINAL MIND


HUBBARD COMMUNICATIONS OFFICE
Saint Hill Manor, East Grinstead, Sussex

HCO BULLETIN OF 15 SEPTEMBER 1981

Remimeo


    THE CRIMINAL MIND


Definition: A criminal is one who is motivated by evil
intentions and who has committed so many harmful overt acts
that he considers such activities ordinary.

There is a datum of value in detecting overts and withholds
in criminal individuals:

THE CRIMINAL ACCUSES OTHERS OF THINGS WHICH HE HIMSELF IS
DOING.

As an example, the psychiatrist accuses others engaged in
mental practice of harming others or worsening their
condition, yet the majority of psychiatrists maim and kill
their patients and, by record, in all history have only
worsened mental conditions. After all, that's what they
seem to be paid to do by the government.

The psychologist accuses others of misrepresenting what
they do and lobbies in legislature continually to outlaw
others on the accusation of misrepresenting but there is no
psychologist who doesn't know that he himself is a fake,
can accomplish nothing of value and that his certificates
aren't even worth the printing ink. The psychologist goes
further: He educates little children in all the schools to
believe all men are soulless animals and criminals so that
when the possible day of reckoning comes and the
psychologist is exposed for what he is, the population will
not be the least bit surprised and will consider the
psychologist is "normal."

The psychologist accuses others of sexual irregularities
when this is, actually, his entire profession.

Jack the Ripper of English fame who gruesomely murdered
prostitutes now turns out to have been a medical doctor 
and was undoubtedly of enormous assistance to the police 
in pointing out "the real murderer."

The FBI agent or executive accuses others of graft and even
sets up "abscams" to manufacture the crime. But an FBI
agent regularly pockets money supposed to be paid to
informers and then screams to protect informer sources that
do not exist.

The FBI agent is terrified of being infiltrated and accuses
others of it when, as standard practice, he infiltrates
groups, manufactures evidence and then gets others charged
for crimes his own plants have committed.

The FBI acts like a terrorist group posing as law
enforcement officers. Their targets seem to be legislators
and Congress and public individuals who might someday have
power over public opinion, such as Martin Luther King, Jr.

From all this we get another datum:

THE CRIMINAL MIND RELENTLESSLY SEEKS TO DESTROY ANYONE
IT IMAGINES MIGHT EXPOSE IT.

You have to be very alert when criminals are around.

J. Edgar Hoover, who organized the present FBI and is still
deified by it- they have his name in huge, brass letters on
Washington, DC's biggest thoroughfare-and that town doesn't
even have the names of former presidents up in lights-has
been shown by subsequent records to have been a blackmailer
and traitor to his country. He carefully, personally sat on
the information for four months that Pearl Harbor was going
to happen. Right up to the US entrance into World War II,
he was autographing his photo for pals in the deadly German
SS. He even sacked an FBI agent (Tureau) who dared to catch
some German spies.

Doctors, psychologists, psychiatrists and the government
form a tight clique.

Only the government would support such people as the public
hates them.

From all this we get another datum:

INDIVIDUALS WITH CRIMINAL MINDS TEND TO BAND TOGETHER
SINCE THE PRESENCE OF OTHER CRIMINALS ABOUT THEM TENDS TO
PROVE THEIR OWN DISTORTED IDEAS OF MAN IN GENERAL.

It is not true that where any person accuses another of a
crime the accuser is always guilty of the crime or that
type of crime. But it is true that when a criminal is doing
the accusing it is more than probable that the criminal is
disclosing his own type of crime.

Apparently they add it up this way: "If I accuse him of
robbing, then it would be assumed by others that I have not
robbed a bank." By loudly voicing a condemnation of a
crime, the criminal, with a crooked think, supposes people
will now suppose he is above bank robbery and won't suspect
him.

Groups like psychologists who declare as fact that all men
are criminals are of course just dramatizing their own
inclinations.

People assume that others have their own case. The
psychologist pushes his own case off on the whole world.

Anyone researching in the mind should be very aware of this
point and be sure not to do it. Subjective reality seems to
them to be the only reality there is, for such people are
too introverted to really know the minds and motivations of
others.

When working with the criminal, one can get a very good
idea of that person's own mental state by getting him to
say what other people want and do or are guilty of.

It is inconceivable to the criminal that anyone could
possibly be decent or honest or do a selfless act. It would
do no good whatever to try to convince him, for he knows
all men are like himself.

Thus, one gets another datum of value:

THE CRIMINAL ONLY SEES OTHERS AS HE HIMSELF IS.

One of the reasons he does this, of course, is to justify
injuring others. Because everyone else is useless,
worthless, criminal, an animal and insane, why then, he
reasons, it is perfectly all right to injure them.

Thus, we come to another datum:

THE CRIMINAL IS NOT MUCH BENEFITED BY THE GIVING OFF OF
CURRENT WITHHOLDS AND IS NOT LIKELY TO REFORM BECAUSE OF
THIS.

One, therefore, has to get down to the basic evil intentions, 
as in Expanded Dianetics.

There is another approach in that same area of technology
which is finding what act the person really can take
responsibility for. It is a gradient approach.

The criminal is basically so subjective that an auditor
will find, in the short run, that improving the reality of
such a person is needful before any effective, overall
improvement is obtained through pulling withholds.

Thus, TRs and 8-C and even ARC Straightwire are indicated
as first steps. If these are done, and as responsibility
rises, expect that overts could begin to pop up almost of
their own accord.

It is interesting that if a criminal were to face up
suddenly to the enormity of his crimes he would go into
degradation and self-destruction. Thus, a gradient scale is
definitely indicated.

As the person has more R (reality), he can take more
responsibility and only then with pulling withholds can he
have any real benefit.

This HCOB is simply some data on the criminal mind that might help.

At the very least it should give some understanding of why
some individuals insist with such apparent conviction that
all men are evil, why all men are insane, why all men are
criminals.

And it also tells you how silly it is to try to argue with
them. Who's there? The criminal mind is a bitter and
unsavory subject. The percentage of criminals is relatively
small but the majority of grief and turmoil in the world
caused by criminals is a majority percent. Thus, the
criminal mind is a subject one cannot avoid in research as
it is a major factor in the distortion of a culture.

It is a mind like any other mind but it has gone wrong. It
is motivated by evil intentions which, even if idiotic, are
greater than the possessor's ability to reason. The
criminal, even when he seems most clever, is really very,
very stupid. The evil intentions get dramatized by
senseless overt acts which are then withheld, and the final
result is a person who is more dead than alive and who
faces a future so agonizing that any person would shudder
at it. The criminal, in fact, has forfeited his life and
any meaning to it even when he remains "uncaught" and
"unpunished," for in the long run, he has caught himself
and punishes himself for all eternity. No common judge
can give a sentence as stiff as that.

They know down deep that this is true and that is why they
scream with such ferocity that men have no souls. They
can't confront the smallest part of what awaits them.

When you understand what the criminal mind consists of, you
can also understand how ghastly must be the feelings or lack 
of them with which the criminal has to live within himself 
and for all his days forever. He is more to be pitied than
punished. Neither bold nor brave, for all his pretense, he
is really just a panicky, whimpering coward inside. When he
bares his breast against the bullets, he does so with the
actual hope that he will be killed. But of course that
doesn't save him. He's got an eternity of it left to go.
And his scoff of any such data hides the whimper, for he
knows, deep down, it's true.

Thus, we have another datum:

THE CRIMINAL, NO MATTER WHAT HARM HE IS DOING TO OTHERS,
IS ALSO SEEKING TO DESTROY HIMSELF. HE IS IN PROTEST AGAINST HIS
OWN SURVIVAL.

If you have to work with criminals in pastoring, recognize
what you are working with. He can be helped-if he will let
you near him.

Fortunately, there are still a lot of decent people left in
the world.

all of the data in the original issue, (b) updates it to
align with HCOB 21 Aug. 79, TWINNING, and to include
additional data on Word Clearing tech and additional
references.)

DEFINITION

Method 3 Word Clearing is the method of finding a student's
misunderstood word by having him look earlier in the text
than where he is having trouble for a word he doesn't
understand.

____________

An F/Ning student is one who is tearing along successfully
in his studies. One must know how to keep a student F/Ning.
This is the responsibility of the Supervisor and the
student himself. On any course where students are twinned,
it is also the responsibility of the twin.

A student who uses study tech will look up each word he
comes to that he doesn't understand and will never leave a
word behind him that he doesn't know the meaning of.

If he runs into trouble, the student himself, the
Supervisor (or the twin) would handle anything that slowed
or interfered with the student's F/N. This is often most
simply done with Method 3 Word Clearing.

Students don't put themselves or each other on a meter to 
locate a misunderstood word. They use Method 3 procedure, 
as described below. It doesn't require a meter (though the
Supervisor or Word Clearer may meter a student to find his
misunderstood word should it become necessary). Method 3
does, however, require a good understanding of the
following theory and procedure.

Using dope-off as the only detection of misunderstoods is
operating at below F/N level. The F/N went off long before
the student reached the point of dopeoff, so waiting for
dope-off to occur before handling is waiting too long. As
soon as the student's study stats drop for half a day or he
isn't quite so "bright" as he was fifteen minutes ago is
the time to look for the misunderstood word. It's not a
misunderstood phrase or idea or concept but a misunderstood
WORD. This always occurs before the subject itself is not
understood.


METHOD 3 STYLE WORD CLEARING PROCEDURE

1. The student is not flying along and is not so "bright"
as he was or he may exhibit just plain lack of enthusiasm
or be taking too long on the checksheet or be yawning or
disinterested or doodling or daydreaming, etc.

2. The student must then look earlier in the text for a
misunderstood word. There is one always; there are no
exceptions. It may be that the misunderstood word is two
pages or more back, but it is always earlier in the text
than where the student is now.

3. The word is found. The student recognizes it in looking
back for it. Or, if the student can't find it, one can take
words from the text that could be the misunderstood word
and ask "What does mean?" to see if the student gives the
correct definition.

4. The student looks up the word found in a dictionary and
clears it per HCOB 23 Mar. 78RA, W/C Series 59RA, CLEARING
WORDS. He uses it verbally several times in sentences of his 
own composition until he has obviously demonstrated he 
understands the word by the composition of his sentences.

5. The student now reads the text that contained the
misunderstood word. If he is not now "bright," eager to get
on with it, back uptone, etc., then there is another
misunderstood word earlier in the text. This is found by
repeating steps 2-5.

6. When the student is bright, uptone, etc., (an F/Ning
student), he is told to come forward, studying the text
from where the misunderstood word was to the area of the
subject he did not understand (where step 1 began).

The student will now be enthusiastic with his study of the
subject, and that is the end result of Method 3. (The
result won't be achieved if a misunderstood word was missed
or if there is an earlier misunderstood word in the text.
If so, repeat steps 2-5.) If the student is now enthusiastic, 
have him continue with studying.

Students do NOT have to be word cleared Method 2 on the
total of any course.

However, should it happen that the word cannot be found
with Method 3, then it would be permissible to use one or
more of the other methods of Word Clearing to get the word
found.

____________

Good Word Clearing is a system of backtracking. You have to
look earlier than the point where the student became dull
or confused and you'll find that there's a word that he
doesn't understand somewhere before the trouble started. If
he doesn't brighten up when the word is found and cleared,
there will be a misunderstood word even before that one.

This will be very clear to you if you understand that IF IT 
IS NOT RESOLVING, THE THING THE STUDENT IS APPARENTLY HAVING
TROUBLE WITH IS NOT THE THING THE STUDENT IS HAVING TROUBLE
WITH. Otherwise, it would resolve, wouldn't it? If he knew
what he didn't understand, he could resolve it himself. So
to talk to him about what he thinks he doesn't understand
just gets nowhere. The trouble is earlier.


ZEROING IN ON THE WORD

The formula is to find out where the student wasn't having
any trouble and find out where the student is now having
trouble and the misunderstood word will be in between. It
will be at the tag end of where he wasn't having trouble.
(See Tape 6408C06, Study Tape 4, "Study-Gradients and
Nomenclature," and HCO PL 24 Oct. 68 IV, SUPERVISOR
KNOW-HOW, TIPS IN HANDLING STUDENTS . )

Method 3 is tremendously effective when done as described
herein. So get a good reality on it and become expert in
its use. Use it to keep Scientology working.
