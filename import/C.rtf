 is a much misunderstood state of being. The word has been used before with other meanings. It has been mistaken
 as an absolute. It is still used. It is used here as electronics slang and can apply to a chain, an incident or a computation. Applied to an individual, it means a being who no longer has his own reactive mind. A Clear is an unaberrated person and is rat
i
onal in that he forms the best possible solutions he can on the data he has and from his viewpoint. The Clear has no engrams which can be restimulated to throw out the correctness of computation by entering hidden and false data. (2) (verb) the act of des
e
nsitizing or releasing a thought impression or a series of impressions or observations in the past, or a postulate, an emotion, an effort or an entire facsimile. The preclear either releases his hold on the facsimile (memory) or the facsimile itself is de
sensitized. The word is taken from electronic computers or common office adding machines and describes an action similar to clearing past computations from the machine. \emdash }{\f0\ul APA Glossary }{\f0 (app 11.7.90)
