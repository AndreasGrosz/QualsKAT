 Anyone who confuses astral bodies with thetans is apt to have difficulty with theta clearing for the two things are not the same order of similarity. The exteriorization of a thetan, when actually accomplished, is so complete and thorough and is attended
 
by so many other phenomena, that anyone who has made an effort to relate these two things is quite certain to recant after he has been theta cleared. The most noteworthy difference is that the thetan does not have a body. Production of illusion to which h
e then sought to assign mest reality is probably the underlying factor which makes mysticism so aberrative. Data from India, even that found in the deepest \ldblquote mysteries\rdblquote  of India, is knowingly or unknowingly \ldblquote booby-trapped,
\rdblquote  so that while it contains, though 
unevaluated and isolated, many essential truths, it contains as well directions which are certain to send the experimenter even more deeply into the unwanted state of becoming mest. Until recently, the nearest one could come to studying the actuality of e
x
istence was through the field of mysticism and its value should not be discounted, but its effect is to deliver an entirely opposite result to any experimenter luckless enough to hope to reach cause by becoming an effect as required in mysticism. Seeing a
nd feeling \ldblquote nonexistences\rdblquote 
 is frightening and harmful only when one seeks to believe them to be existences. Only when he knows he has created them can he obtain a certainty upon them. One can create hallucination for himself only by insisting that what he h

 first published in 1811. It purports to relate an incident in the boyhood of the author: One morning a man with an ax over his shoulder greeted the boy most pleasantly and asked if his father had a grindstone. When the boy said, \ldblquote Yes,
\rdblquote  the man complimented him upon his good looks and intelligence and asked if he might borrow the use of the stone. The boy, flatt
ered by the attention, was sure that he could. The man then remarked that the boy appeared to be unusually strong for his age. The lad fell for all this flattery, and before he knew it he had been tricked into turning the stone until the very dull ax was 
as sharp as a razor. Just then the school bell was heard to ring; the man's manner changed abruptly, and without a word of thanks or a coin, he berated the boy for being a sluggard and ordered him to be off instantly so as not to be late for school.
