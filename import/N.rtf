battle with England. Nelson was sent to watch the French ships at Toulon, a seaport in southeastern France. A storm came up and under its cover the French fleet escaped. Nels
on followed it in a long pursuit and finally cornered the French fleet in the Bay of Abukir in northern Egypt, where he attacked and almost destroyed it on 1 August 1798. This engagement cut off Napoleon's army in Egypt and ruined his Egyptian campaign. H

 the investigation of the alleged communist, Alger Hiss (an official in the Department of State who was accused of having been a secret agent for the Soviet Union during the 1930s). He was elected vice-president twice under President Eisenhower, but later
 lost the presidential election of 1960 to John F. Kennedy. Nixon ran for governor of California in 1962 but was defeated at which point he retired from politics for several years and re-emerged as the president at the end of the 60s. \emdash }{\f0\ul

 three sons, and three daughters-in-law into it, along with a pair of each of the Earth's animals. When Noah had done so, God sent forty days and forty nights of rain, until the entire globe was flooded, and all living creatures were drowned. When the rai
