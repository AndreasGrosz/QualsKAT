 be impossible. His last film, }{\f0\ul\cf1 Porgy and Bess}{\f0\cf1  (1959), based on a play about a crippled black beggar, was 
extremely controversial and received a great deal of attention before filming even started. Many blacks protested the filming of this story because they felt that it was a giant step backward in their fight for equality\'d1
