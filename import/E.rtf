\par }{\b\f0 Einstein time formula:}{\f0  reference to the special theory of relativity developed by Albert Einstein (1879 - 1955
), German physicist and US citizen from 1940. Although complete understanding of this theory requires a knowledge of the most exotic branches of mathematics, these are some of its basic points: (1) Time is not an absolute. The faster a body moves, the slo
wer its clock runs. A minute on Earth may pass in fifty-nine seconds or sixty-one seconds on planets traveling at speeds different from that of Earth. (2) The speed of light remains constant in all frames of reference. Whether you are moving toward a ligh
t 
source or away from it, the light will still reach you at the same speed (186,000 miles per second). (3) All motion is relative. Therefore, there can be no such thing as absolute rest. (4) Moving bodies acquire mass as they increase in speed. The faster a
 body travels, the heavier it becomes. As a body approaches the speed of light, it adds mass very rapidly. If it were to reach the speed of light, its mass would become infinite. If this were true it could be seen that no body could ever travel faster tha

The officer, whether king, president or other chief magistrate, who superintends the execution of the laws; the person who administers the government, executive power or authority in government.\rdblquote 
 Executive is used in distinction from legislative and judicial. The body that deliberates and enacts laws is legislative; the body that judges or applies the laws to particular cases is judicial; 
the body or person who carries the laws into effect or superintends the enforcement of them is executive, according to its nineteenth-century governmental meaning according to Webster. The word comes from the Latin \ldblquote }{\f0\ul Ex(s)equi}{\f0 
 (past participle }{\f0\ul ex(s)ecutus}{\f0 ), execute, follow to the end: }{\f0\ul ex}{\f0 -, completely + }{\f0\ul sequi,}{\f0  to follow.\rdblquote  In other words, he follows things to the end and }{\f0\ul gets something done.}{\f0  \emdash }{\f0\ul
