CROSS AUDITING


When one runs Incident II out of one thetan and then Incident 1 out of another (thinking it was the first one) one can get a partially run body thetan who won’t blow but who may start to go on through the whole of R6 automatically (since the basic basic Incident I is not run yet Incident II is.) One can get quite ill doing this as the illness in R6 can turn on.
One can also “feel no wish to audit”. All “no desire to audit” is some large blunder on a case.
The way you can run Inc II out of one thetan and Inc I out of another is rather easy. One fails to notice the first one blew on having Inc II run and runs Inc I on another.
The handling is to use a narrow enough attention span when addressing a BT and to ensure one does not jump from one BT to another.
