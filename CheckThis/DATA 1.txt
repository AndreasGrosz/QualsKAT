Data (1)

The Head of the Galactic Confederation (76 planets around larger stars visible from here) (founded 95,000,000 years ago, very space opera) solved overpopulation (250 billion or SP per planet – 178 billion average) by mass implanting.
He caused people to be brought to Teegeeack (Earth) and put on H Bomb on the principal volcanoes (incident 2) and then the Pacific area ones were taken in boxes to Hawaii and Atlantic area ones to Las Palmas and there „packaged“.
His name was Xenu. He used renegades. Various misleading data by means of circuits etc. was placed in the implants.
When through with his crime (to the people) Loyal Officers captured him after 6 years of battle and put him in an electronic mountain trap where he still is. „They“ are gone. The place (Confed.) has since been a desert.

Data (2)

The length and brutality of all was such that this Confederation never recovered. The implant is calculated to kill (by pneumonia etc.) anyone who attempts to solve it. This liability has been dispensed with by my tech development. One can FREE WHEEL through the implant and die unless it is approached as precisely outlined.
The „free wheel“ (onto running on and on) lasts too long, denies sleep etc. and one dies: to be careful to do only incident 1 and 2 as given and not plow around and fail to complete one thetan at a time.
In December 67 I knew somebody had to take the plunge. I did and emerged very knocked out but alive. Probably the only one ever to do so in 75,000,000 years. I have all the data now but only that given here is needful.
One’s body is a mass of individual thetans stuck to oneself or to the body.
One has to clean them off by running Incident One, then Incident Two. It’s a long job, requiring care, patience and good auditing.
You are running beings. They respond like any preclear. Some large, some small.
Thetans believed they were one. This is the primary error.
Good luck.
