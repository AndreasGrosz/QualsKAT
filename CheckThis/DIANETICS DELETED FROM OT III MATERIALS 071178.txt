DIANETICS DELETED FROM OT III MATERIALS

(Ref: HCOB 14 Sept 1978, DIANETICS FORBIDDEN ON CLEARS AND OTs.)


PER HCOB 14 Sep 78 Clear Dianetic Clears and OTs are not to be run on any form of Dianetics.
No Dianetics means no Dianetic Assists, No R3R or R3RA, no secondary running, no engram running, no narrative running.
Thus, where Dianetics or R3R action is referred to in the existing OT III materials, this handling step is CANCELLED.
One does run BTs through incident Is and IIs, per the materials, one can also Date and Locate.
The instruction to run ones own incident 2 and Incident I is cancelled, as one cannot run engrams on a clear or above.
Should a Pre-OT on OT III run into difficulty he cannot sort out he is given a Review session by an AO Review Auditor.
