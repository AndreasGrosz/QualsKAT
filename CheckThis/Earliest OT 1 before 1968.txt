Earliest OT 1

1.  On an E-Meter, find the last 3,000 years of lifetimes.  Plot
out the entire 3,000 year chart as follows:

(a)  Find an overt lifetime.  Get the identity and the
approximate dates of birth and death.  Find the overt
and pull all the justifications to it.

(b)  Find the following motivator lifetime, and follow
procedure as above.  (Identity and dates.)

(c)  Find the postulate from each lifetime and the basic
postulate in each group of lifetimes.

(d)  Continue the first three steps until the entire 3,000
years is charted and the individuals kharma, i.e. (over
motivator sequence) becomes apparent.

(e) In some cases additional benefit could be  obtained  by
locating the basic misunderstood which proceeded the
basic overt on this chain.

SECOND OT 1

(may have become the second OT 4 briefly before becoming
the first OT 5.  Then replaced by the later "Old OT 5/6"
of the 1970s which is an upgrade of route 1 type OT drills.)


Second OT I

(a) Route I ... The entire 15 steps as listed  in  "Creation
of Human Ability".

(b) With an E-Meter, scan out entire present lifetime  to  a
floating needle.

(c)  Mock-up heat until body feels warm.

(d)  Postulating mass: With the use of the E-Meter and  the
command "I have Mass", create a reactive mind.  Put
sufficient significance on to,it to cause the T.A-  to
rise.  Then spot it until the T.A. falls and  the  mass
erases.  Run to an FIN.  Then mock it up again and erase
it each time to a floating needle.  This  procedure  is
repeated until the pre-OT is certain he can create  and
dissipate a reactive mind.

*******************************************

Third OT I

The current OT I is done outdoors and consists solely of one

command run until cognition.


"Spot a person"

concludes OT I

FOURTH OT 1

(the clearing course repeat which later became the Old OT 4
used througout the 1970s.  Per Fishman, that OT 4 was as follows
and this mostly matches my recall of the level except that were
a few more extra steps at the end.)

OT IV SOLO
The end phenomenon of OT IV is "Certainty of Self as a
Being".  The thing that would make a Being uncertain is the
possibility of future implants.  OT iv Solo is designed to "proof
up a Being" against any possibility of being re-implanted now that
he/she has finished running implants with the completion of OT
The main idea on OT IV Solo is to mock-up (create) each line
of the Cle aring Course (7's, The Basic End Words, The Confusion
GPM, Objects-Hollow, Objects-Solid) with all the perceptics,
force, impact, and unconsciousness of the original implant (as
much as you are able).  When the line is mocked up (created or
recreated), then unmock it, cease creating it, and blow the charge
you have recreated or mocked up.  Do this repetitively with each
line of the Clearing Course (including lights) to a floating
needle on each line.  Continue until you feel totally free with
and at cause over this implant sequence; (you may or may not need
to complete all 5 parts).  Do it until you can freely and easily
mock-up and blow this implant and can confront implants.
Lastly, scan out all of your auditing early to late adding up
all the hours in session as you go along.

Part 12. The modern OT 1

(But rumor has it that this was replaced recently.)

(This is per Scamizdat.  I recall these steps but I think that
there may have been 2 more, possibly added later)


      27 July 68

           OT

       Section 1

     Instructions

This section is done outside in the Open Air. It is done off a meter. But
TA should be taken before and after doing the section. If the TA has gone
high, a step has been (a) not flattened or (b) overrun. Find out on a meter
which it is. Handle it.

It is not the intention of this section to exteriorise anyone but if it
happens don't worry about it or fool around with the fact.

An auditors [sic] report is due for each session which can be one or more
of these drills.

A great many phenomena (strange things) can happen while doing these
drills if they are done honestly.

Don't do a session on these drills if you have an ARC Br, a w/h, a PTP,
are PTS or are ill. Instead, go to review first. Do these (and any others
[sic]) OT Section sessions with rudiments in.

If one of these drills turns on a somatic, the drill should turn it off if
continued.

Good Luck

(Cancels Earlier OT1 Materials which were a Clearing Course Repeat)

1. Walk around and count bodies until you have a cognition.
   Make a report saying how many you counted and your cognition.

2. Note several large and several small female bodies until you
   have a cognition. Note it down.

3. Note several large and several small male bodies until you
   have a cognition. Note it down.

4. Find a tight packed crowd of people, note it as a crowd, then
   as individuals until you have a cognition. Note it down. Do
   step over until you do.

5. Seat yourself unobtrusively where you can observe a number of
   people. Spot things and people you are not. Do to cognition.
   Note it.

6. Seat yourself unobtrusively where you can observe a number of
   people. Spot things and people you can have. Do to cognition.
   Note it.

7. Note some physical thing about yourself you don't like.
   Observing people, in them note that body part. Do to some
   change. Note it down.

8. Observing people, spot things that are not wrong with them. Do
   to cognition. Note it.

9. Walk around and note someone walking toward you, then someone
   walking away, then someone walking toward you, etc. Do to
   cognition. Note it down.

10. Walk around and note how people stick to the ground and
    their sense of weight. Do to cognition. Note it down.

11. Spot importances in people while looking at them. Do to
    cognition. Note it down.

12. Look into space and find places where there are no persons.
    Do to cognition. Note it down.
