SECRET

LDN OT III RB

This list is for use on a pc who is OT III or above.
When an impasse occurs or the pc gets upset, the auditor (who must be an OT III or above) assesses this list and works out from what is found to read, what has gone wrong.
DO NOT RUN ANY R3R, R3RA OR ANY DIANETICS
L1C can be used on a BT.
L7 can be used on a BT.

GRADES

You can also run Grades O-IV on a BT.

OUT INT

A BT can be having trouble with Out Int, requiring the End of Endless Int Repair RECALL process (but no R3R).

EARLIER INC I, EARLIER UNIVERSE

The most common difficulty you get into with a BT that doesn’t blow is there was an earlier Inc I, some have several earlier Inc I’s, and when you get down to the first Inc I you’re liable to jump from one BT to another, if you keep asking for an earlier.
And if earlier Inc I doesn’t work, then it’s “earlier universe?” – the BT recognizes there was an earlier universe – the BT will spot this and blow.
(Caution: There is an implant which miscounts the number of earlier universes, making it seem there were far more than there were.)
