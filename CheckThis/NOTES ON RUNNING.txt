SECTION III OT
ADDITIONAL SHEET


NOTES ON RUNNING


Certain „buttons“ have to be gotten in when running a thetan through incidents.
The effort to stop the motion hangs up the action and gives a stuck picture. One gets the effort to stop off and the scene races through.
The effort to withdraw is important also and hangs up the action and creates a vacuum.
RUSH, PROTEST, NOT-IS, SUPPRESS are also present.
There were action – thoughts – the thetan had during the incident and are picked up only when the incident doesn’t run well.
Sometimes 2 „buttons“ such as Stop and Withdraw are in combination.
____________________

Thetans in the body may obsessively copy the pictures of other thetans. Therefore you can find it seems that the thetan who just left is still there because there is a picture left. Spot the fact that someone else copied it and it usually goes.

If you do an S&D on a body thetan be sure you give the right item to the right thetan.
