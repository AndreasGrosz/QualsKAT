THE "L" RUNDOWNS

INTR0DUCTI0N

The L's were developed as a result of research into the levels above OT VIII. The success of the L's is startling.  These rundowns can handle things that are handled nowhere else.

The breakthrough which exists here technically is so strong that it actually cuts through the normal protective mechanisms of the mind. It came actually from the OT Grades. It answers the question -- Why does an OT restrain himself and cease to behave as an OT?

Each rundown is designed to terminatedly handle a specific area of a person's case. The L's are not grades in themselves but incredible boosters. The basic tech comes from research into increasing OT powers. They're a special class of rundown; they increase a person's power and effectiveness.

Part of the discovery was that this tech could be used lower down on the Bridge to get people up it faster -- very much faster.

The L's address the basics of a thetan's case directly. They undercut tbe reactive mind and handle those factors which suppress the capacity to actually Do, Be and Have. They remove those things that can make a person less himself and far less powerful and causative as a thetan. These rundowns are designed to find and erase the basic counter intentions along one's dynamics. They stabilize a case.

The L's require experts to run them. The auditor's TRs have to be perfect and there is no room for flubs. So don't audit these rundowns on a PC or PreOT until your auditing is flawless.

In all the "L" Rundowns (L10, Lll, and L12) the PC or PreOT is fully set up first with a C/S 53 and GF40 expanded if needed.

THE "L" RUNDOWNS

L RUNDOWN TERMINAL PROCEDURE

When a terminal is found on any of the L&N list questions, the C/S
and/or auditor observes one of the following two possiblities:

A. The item found on the L&N question is an identity type
valence which is or has been an identity or valence
of the PC/PreOT. For example, an engineer or Sherlock
Holmes are identity type valences.

B. The item is another being who the PC/PreOT has known
as with the VA Power Plus "Person" list item.  For
example, John Smith or my father are people who the
PC or PreOT has known. There is no strict guideline
on this; the C/S or auditor has to obnose which
category the item fits into (A or B).

If the item turns out to be by observation an identity
type valence as in A above, you then handle as follows:

Identity Type Valence Handling

Place the item in the following commands and run to EP:

1, What has (a)______________________________done?

Z. What has (a)____________________________withheld?

For example:

1. What has Sherlock Holmes done?
2. What has Sherlock Holmes withheld?

Next L&N the question:

What would be the basic intention/purpose of (a)__________________?

For example:

What would be the basic intention/purpose of
Sherlock Holmes?

Use intention or purpose, whichever communicates or
reads best.

Take the LFBD F/N iten found and for a PC use:

Locate an incident that contains the
intention/purpose___________


For example:

"to dumbfound others"

For a PC use:

Locate an incident that contains the intention/purpose
to dumbfound others.

Be sure it is an evil intention or purpose.

Run the item quad R3RA to full erasure.

If it is a good or positive intention, rehab it.
Then 2 W/C -- "What progress have you made in achieving that
purpose?"

For a PreOT:

Find out if the intention/purpose is:

1.YOURS
2.A BODY THETANS
3.A CLUSTERS

If YOURS reads, have PreOT:

Run recalls quad to EP
or,

Locate an incident that contains the intention/
purpose to_________________

D/L earlier D/L to basic if needed.
Pick up other flows if they read and also D/L
earlier D/L to basic.

If BT reads, have PreOT:

i. Locate BT's position relative to the body
(should be reading).

Handling

Ask it, "Is (intention) yours?"  If yes and no
F/N, "Recall a time when you had the intention
to ( ________ )" (back to the first time).

If answer is "no" and BT protests, check false.
The false question being, "Did anyone ever say
you had the intention to ( _______ ) when you
really didn't?"

Then blow with OT III or

-- 2 --



NOTS procedure if not blown on recalls.
Alternate Handling

l. Assess the incident list from the OT or NOTS
Drug Rundown to determine what type of incident
caused the individual to have that intention.
2. D/L earlier D/L to basic or blow the incident
found.
3. If needed, finish up with OT III or NOTS procedure
depending on where the PreOT is on the Grade Chart.

If Cluster reads, have PreOT:

1. Locate Cluster's position relative to the body.
(should be reading)
2. Assess the Incident list from the OT or NOTS
Drug Rundown to find out what type of mutual
incident caused the cluster to be formed.
3. D/L earlier D/L to basic, break up or blow of
cluster.
4. Find out if there are any individuals left
over from cluster and if there are, handle
with OT III or NOTS procedure depending an
where PreOT is on the Grade Chart.

Assess the other flows of the intention/purpose for reads and
if reading assess:

Is (flow and intention):

YOURS
A BTs
A CLUSTERS

Then handle as above and repeat on all other flows of
intention/purpose.

This is tbe complete identity type valence handling.

If the item turns out to be another being or person who the
PC/PreOT has known in the past or is currently associated with, handle
as follows:

R. Anotber Being or Person Handling

Handling for a PC:
1. Run the being or person O/W quad flow:

Fl  What has_________done to you?
  What has________ withheld from you?

F2  What have you done to_________?

What have you withheld from_________________________?

-  3  -


F3  What has_________to others?
What has_________withheld from others?

F3A What have others done to________?
What have others withheld from____________?

FO  What have you done to yourself because
of_________?
What have you withheld from yourself because
of_________?

For example:

Fl    What has Sherlock Holmes done to you?  
What has Sherlock Holmes withheld from you"

Then do F2, F3, F3A, and FO as usual.

Other terminal type processes can be used to make sure the being or
person is flat, for example any ruds or even the processes from the
Suppressed Person Rundown can be used.

2. Date/locate the first time the PC ever met that being or
person. If the D/L was only of a meeting of a human composite, recent
life, go earlier to find first encounter with that being or person and
D/L to a blow on that being or person. This is different phenomenon
than OT III or NOTs, but if the being or person was a BT, the first
encounter would predate the incident that caused it to be a BT and
blow it.

If needed, recheck:
Is (intention/purpose) also:
(with original intention/purpose)

Yours
a (another) BT's
a (another) Cluster's

Leaving out "Yours" if already run.
Then handle as above.

This completes the handling of another being or person for a PC.

Handling for a PreOT:

l. Assess to find out if the charge on the terminal (being
or person) belongs to the PreOT, a BT or a cluster.

Is the charge on (item found)

Yours
a BT's
a Cluster's

--  4  --


Then do the 0/W step above on the whichever reads.

2. Do the D/L step as above on the first meeting accordingly
(PreOT, BT's or cluster's as determined in step 1).

3. If it was a BT or cluster and the BT or cluster has not
blown by this time handle per the usual OT III or NOTs
procedure to a blow.

If needed, recheck:

Is (intention/purpose) also:

(With original intention/purpose)

Yours
a (another) BT's
a (another) Cluster's

Leaving out "Yours" if already run,
Then handle as above.

This completes the handling of another being or person for a PreOT.

The above procedure can be used on any of the L Rundowns to flatten
any terminal which found on any L&N list.

THE "L" RUNDOWNS

THE L10 RUNDOWN INTRODUCTION

L10 is designed to handle the things a thetan uses to restrain
himself.  The person regains his ability and power to do those things
he intends to do and as a result he feels more at cause than ever
before.  L10 is an action that really releases a person's power on the
third and fourth dynamic. It takes off the stops that hold a person
back on these dynamics.

L1O will boost the individual's confront and responsibility level and
consequently raise his doingness level.

PREREQUISITES: L10 is not restricted to only those who have completed
OT III. The only prerequisites to L10 are a complete NED Drug R/D and
Expanded Grades. It may not be done in the Non-interference Zone
between Grade VI R6EW and OTIII.

Note -- All assessing is done M-6 (the L10 method of assessing a list).
You look at the PC or PreOT and ask him directly every item or
question on the list.(Tape recording 7106C12)

THE L10 RUNDOWN STEP TWO

STEP TWO: IDENTITIES

This part of the L10 Rundown consists of 37 L&N actions to be
listed per the Laws of Listing and Nulling to a BD F/N item. They are
done in the order listed. On the purpose/intention list, if you get
VVGI's BD F/N and major case cognition or valence shift, that's it on
that step. If it goes to BD F/N VGI's, not a real blow out, then run
the item R3RA quad or run recall on it or D/L for a PreOT at OT III or
above. This rundown undercuts OT III and NOTS. It breaks up a case in
a very subtle fashion. Be sure not to audit over a persistent F/N. You
may only be able to do one list each session. This blows off beings,
valences, overwhelm, confusion and increases reach vastly.

The basic L&N questions are:

Who or What (W/W) was (Item from list) ?
or
Who or What would have been (Item from list) ?
or
What past identity was (Item from list) ?
or
What past identity would have been (Item from list) ?

Use the question which communicates best to the PC or PreOT
and gives the biggest read.

ITEM LIST

Note- All assessing is done M-6 (the L10 method of assessing a list).
You look at the PC or PreOT and ask him directly every item or
question on the list.(7106C12)

1. CRITICAL
2. UNAPPRECIATIVE

What is the worst thing you have ever done (ever)?

The "(ever)" means you really emphasize ever in clearing
the question.

Once you get the overt, you then L&N to get the identity:

Who or what would (do) (overt from above) ?

Find the item and handle per the procedure given in

DYNAMIC PROCESSING CHECKS

The following letter and Dynamic Processing Checks were
received from Jan Halpern, International Council Member.  They
are for use as zero questions.

"Dear Ron,

You mentioned in D.C. that some dynamic processing checks
would be useful.  Here are some.  They're more of a nucleus
than a really full set of questions.  I suspect there are gaps
large enough to drive tanks through which are not obvious to
me at this point.  So, it would be nice it they were added to
by somebody whose dynamic blind spots and mish-meshes are
different from mine!

THE "L" RUNDOWNS

THE L11 RUNDOWN INTRODUCTION

L11, The New Life Rundown was developed to give a person a new life.
This means it can handle that part of an individual's case which stops
him from really living.  It handles the major source of aberration
upon which attention is fixed, blasting apart that major personal
stumbling block.

The EP of L11 is a New Life.

PREREQUISITES:  Lll (formerly L9S) is not restricted to only those who
have completed OT III.  The only prerequisites to Lll are a complete
Drug R/D and Expanded Grades.  It may not be done in the
Non-interference Zone between Grade VI, R6EW and OT III.

In all the "L" Rundowns (L10, Lll, and L12), the PC or PreOT is fully
set up first with a C/S 53 and GF40 expanded if needed.

STEP ONE: 37R

Do the full 37R Rundown as given in C/S Series 37R.

Items from 37R Rundown L&N lists can be blown by D/L if
needed.

They can also be checked for "Yours", "a BT'S, "A cluster's"
for PreOT's and handled appropriately.

THE L11 RUNDOWN STEP TWO

STEP TWO: JUSTIFICATION

1. Have PC or PreOT read the HCOB entitled "JUSTIFICATION".

2. 2 w/c "How have you justified your overts?"
(Be sure question reads)

3. L&N "What evil purpose have you had?"to BD F/N item.

Take the LFBD F/N item found and for a PC use:

Locate an incident that contains the
evil purpose

For example:

"to dumbfound others"

For a PC use:

Locate an incident that contains the evil purpose
to dumbfound others.

Be sure it is an evil intention or purpose.
Run the item quad R3RA to full erasure.
For a PreOT:
Find out if the evil purpose is:

1.YOURS
2.A BODY THETANS
3.A CLUSTERS

If YOURS reads, have PreOT:

Locate an incident that contains the evil
purpose to ____________

D/L earlier D/L to basic if needed.
Pick up other flows if they read and also D/L
earlier D/L to basic.

If BT reads, have PreOT:


1. Locate BT's position relative to the body
(should be reading).

2.  Ask it, "Is (intention) yours?"  If yes and
no F/N, "Recall a time when you had the
intention to (______________________)" (back to the
first time).

3.  If answer is "no" and BT protests, check
false.  The false question being, "Did
anyone ever say you had the intention to
( ______________ ) when you really didn't?"

Then blow with OT III or NOTS procedure

l. Assess the Incident list from the OT or NOTS
Drug Rundown to determine what type of incident
caused the individual to have that intention.
2. D/L earlier D/L to basic or blow the incident
found.
3. If needed, finish up with OT III or NOTS procedure
depending on where the PreOT is on the Grade Chart.

If Cluster reads, have PreOT:

1. Locate Cluster's position relative to the body.
(should be reading)
2. Assess the Incident list from the OT or NOTS
Drug Rundown to find out what type of mutual
incident caused the cluster to be formed.
3. D/L earlier D/L to basic, break up or blow of
cluster.
4. Find out if there are any individuals left
over from cluster and if there are, handle
with OT III or NOTS procedure depending on
where PreOT is on the Grade Chart.

End off this step on a major case change, valence shift and/or
ability gained with VVGI's Floating TA and Cognition.

STEP FOUR: L11 WANTS HANDLED RUNDOWN (Basic Aberration Rundown)

An aberrativc or "wants handled" subject is prepchecked.
The session is ended when the prepcheck is complete.

Every PC or PreOT answer is turned into a listing question on a separate sheet.
For example, "On or concerning school, has anything been suppressed?".

The L&N question would be: "Who or What would suppress how hard it is to
study?"

See TECHNICAL BULLETIN 29 JULY 1984, ISSUE III

Steps above are repeated until all "wants handled" items are complete.

4-way O/Ws on terminal found
intention of the terminal
blow it hy D/L
if it was his intention: "what progress have you made?"

THE L12 RUNDOWN INTRODUCTION

The intention behind L12 is to make a fully extroverted and stable
thetan. This rundown aims at handling very basic and specific aspects
of a person's beingness.  Here are those case things which tend to
capture part of the person's attention so he has much less of it to
put on life and doingness.

The person experiences certainty and unshakability as a being with the
ability to handle his own universe.

PREREQUISITES:  L12 is not restricted to only those who have completed
OT III.  The only prerequisites to L12 are a complete Drug R/D and
Expanded Grades.  It may not be done in the Non-interference Zone
between Grade VI, R6EW and OT III.

In all the "L" Rundown' (L10, Lll, and L12) the PC or PreOT is fully
set up first with a C/S 53 and GF40 expanded if needed.

THE L12 RUNDOWN STEP FOUR

STEP FOUR: PTS BEAM HANDLING
METHOD ONE:

l. Ask PC/PreOT, "Do you have any beams stuck to yourself or
the body?"

2. If yes, have him locate a reading beam stuck to himself or
the body.

3. Find out who put it there.

4. D/L the incident when it was put there.

5. Repeat until "no more beams".

6. Repeat above procedure with "field distortions".

7. Repeat until no more "field distortions".

METHOD TWO:

1. PC/PreOT is shown this definition of a BEAM:
"A flow of electricity with teeth and edges."

The definition is illustrated with a picture of a
BODY being beamed by another person, the beam being
hooked into the body by teeth like a circular saw
blade or fish hooks. The thetan is at effect of the
beamed body; no decision, overt, or involvement of
his own being responsible for the effect.
(This data must be kept confidential, as it could
serve to invalidate the wonderful control mechanism
that is necessary to manipulate PC/PreOT thoughts
and behavior. For example, "You must have pulled it
in" or "What was your overt prior to me annoying
you?")

2. A list of terminals is gotten. It must 1nclude all 2D
terminals, friends, enemies, with special emphasis on earlier allies.

3. In order of size of read, ask:

"Did___________________________beam your body?" If yes,


D/L the incident when it was put there.
If this doesn't blow it, one could say to the PC/PreOT,
"Do what you have to do to nullify it."

PC/PreOT blunts the teeth, mocks up water on
it, burns it, zips out his end and lets it fly
back to the owner, etc. This is a last resort as
the D/L is much more clean and neat.

These beams will still be attached as a control mechanism even
if the enemy, family member or 2D is long physically gone.

4. Next take up FIELD DISTORTIONS by asking,

"Do you have any field distortions"

5. Assess the TYPE OF INCIDENT list to find our what
caused it.

6. D/L the incident found to a blow of the field distortion.

STEP FIVE:  OCA TRAIT HANDLING

1.  Go over the PC/PreOT's OCA.

2.  Take each negative area trait and make up a listing
question.  For example:  "critical"

The basic L&N questions are:

Who or What (W/W) was  (Item from OCA)?

W/W would have been  (Item from OCA)?

or

What past identity was  (Item from OCA)?

or

What past identity would have been  (Item from OCA)?

Use the question which communicates best to the PC or PreOT
and gives the biggest read.

Clear the L&N question with the word to be used such as:
W/W was critical?  LF
List and Null to one item such as:
a cranky maid LFBD F/N

See TECHNICAL BULLETIN 29 JULY 1984 ISSUE III L RUNDOWN

STEP SIX:  IDENTITY ASSESSMENT LIST

Assess the subject of the group M6.  The word is called or
shouted very accusatively with the auditor looking directly into the
PC's eyes.  The meter read is noted.  This word is called to
restimulate the group; then the other items of the group are asked as
questions M5.  The identities of one group are handled in order of
size of read.  Then continue on with the next group, etc. When the
whole list is handled, reassess from the beginning and handle each
item as it comes up, taking slowed or checked F/N's as reads.  Handleto
 persistent F/N on the whole list.  Check at the end of each group
if any beingness that was restimulated by the accusative identity was
not on the list.

Handle each identity with the same technique as is used on the

INTR0DUCTI0N

The L's were developed as a result of research into the levels above
OT VIII. The success of the L's is startling.  These rundowns can
handle things that are handled nowhere else.

The breakthrough which exists here technically is so strong that it
actually cuts through the normal protective mechanisms of the mind. It
came actually from the OT Grades. It answers the question -- Why does
an OT restrain himself and cease to behave as an OT?

Each rundown is designed to terminatedly handle a specific area of a
person's case. The L's are not grades in themselves but incredible
boosters. The basic tech comes from research into increasing OT
powers. They're a special class of rundown; they increase a person's
power and effectiveness.

Part of the discovery was that this tech could be used lower down on
the Bridge to get people up it faster -- very much faster.

The L's address the basics of a thetan's case directly. They undercut
tbe reactive mind and handle those factors which suppress the capacity
to actually Do, Be and Have. They remove those things that can make a
person less himself and far less powerful and causative as a thetan.
These rundowns are designed to find and erase the basic counter
intentions along one's dynamics. Tney stabilize a case.

The L's require experts to run them. The auditor's TRs have to be
perfect and there is no room for flubs. So don't audit these rundowns
on a PC or PreOT until your auditing is flawless.

In all the "L" Rundowns (L10, Lll, and L12) the PC or PreOT is fully
set up first with a C/S 53 and GF40 expanded if needed.

valence which is or has been an identity or valence
of the PC/PreOT. For example, an engineer or Sherlock
Holmes are identity type valences.

B. The item is another being who the PC/PreOT has known
as with the VA Power Plus "Person" list item.  For
example, John Smith or my father are people who the
PC or PreOT has known. There is no strict guideline
on this; the C/S or auditor has to obnose which
category the item fits into (A or B).

If the item turns out to be by observation an identity
type valence as in A above, you then handle as follows:

Identity Type Valence Handling

Place the item in the following commands and run to EP:

1, What has (a)______________________________done?

Z. What has (a)____________________________withheld?

For example:

1. What has Sherlock Holmes done?
2. What has Sherlock Holmes withheld?

Next L&N the question:

What would be the basic intention/purpose of (a)__________________?

For example:

What would be the basic intention/purpose of
Sherlock Holmes?

Use intention or purpose, whichever communicates or
reads best.

Take the LFBD F/N iten found and for a PC use:

Locate an incident that contains the
intention/purpose___________


For example:

"to dumbfound others"

For a PC use:

Locate an incident that contains the intention/purpose
to dumbfound others.

Be sure it is an evil intention or purpose.

Run the item quad R3RA to full erasure.

If it is a good or positive intention, rehab it.
Then 2 W/C -- "What progress have you made in achieving that
purpose?"

For a PreOT:

Find out if the intention/purpose is:

1.YOURS
2.A BODY THETANS
3.A CLUSTERS

If YOURS reads, have PreOT:

Run recalls quad to EP
or,

Locate an incident that contains the intention/
purpose to_________________

D/L earlier D/L to basic if needed.
Pick up other flows if they read and also D/L
earlier D/L to basic.

If BT reads, have PreOT:

i. Locate BT's position relative to the body
(should be reading).

Handling

Ask it, "Is (intention) yours?"  If yes and no
F/N, "Recall a time when you had the intention
to ( ________ )" (back to the first time).

If answer is "no" and BT protests, check false.
The false question being, "Did anyone ever say
you had the intention to ( _______ ) when you
really didn't?"

Then blow with OT III or

-- 2 --

NOTS procedure if not blown on recalls.
Alternate Handling

l. Assess the incident list from the OT or NOTS
Drug Rundown to determine what type of incident
caused the individual to have that intention.
2. D/L earlier D/L to basic or blow the incident
found.
3. If needed, finish up with OT III or NOTS procedure
depending on where the PreOT is on the Grade Chart.

If Cluster reads, have PreOT:

1. Locate Cluster's position relative to the body.
(should be reading)
2. Assess the Incident list from the OT or NOTS
Drug Rundown to find out what type of mutual
incident caused the cluster to be formed.
3. D/L earlier D/L to basic, break up or blow of
cluster.
4. Find out if there are any individuals left
over from cluster and if there are, handle
with OT III or NOTS procedure depending an
where PreOT is on the Grade Chart.

Assess the other flows of the intention/purpose for reads and
if reading assess:

Is (flow and intention):

YOURS
A BTs
A CLUSTERS

Then handle as above and repeat on all other flows of
intention/purpose.

This is tbe complete identity type valence handling.

If the item turns out to be another being or person who the
PC/PreOT has known in the past or is currently associated with, handle
as follows:

R. Anotber Being or Person Handling

Handling for a PC:
1. Run the being or person O/W quad flow:

Fl  What has_________done to you?
  What has________ withheld from you?

F2  What have you done to_________?

What have you withheld from_________________________?

-  3  -

F3  What has_________to others?
What has_________withheld from others?

F3A What have others done to________?
What have others withheld from____________?

FO  What have you done to yourself because
of_________?
What have you withheld from yourself because
of_________?

For example:

Fl    What has Sherlock Holmes done to you?  
What has Sherlock Holmes withheld from you"

Then do F2, F3, F3A, and FO as usual.

Other terminal type processes can be used to make sure the being or
person is flat, for example any ruds or even the processes from the
Suppressed Person Rundown can be used.

2. Date/locate the first time the PC ever met that being or
person. If the D/L was only of a meeting of a human composite, recent
life, go earlier to find first encounter with that being or person and
D/L to a blow on that being or person. This is different phenomenon
than OT III or NOTs, but if the being or person was a BT, the first
encounter would predate the incident that caused it to be a BT and
blow it.

If needed, recheck:
Is (intention/purpose) also:
(with original intention/purpose)

Yours
a (another) BT's
a (another) Cluster's

Leaving out "Yours" if already run.
Then handle as above.

This completes the handling of another being or person for a PC.

Handling for a PreOT:

l. Assess to find out if the charge on the terminal (being
or person) belongs to the PreOT, a BT or a cluster.

Is the charge on (item found)

Yours
a BT's
a Cluster's

--  4  --

Then do the 0/W step above on the whichever reads.

2. Do the D/L step as above on the first meeting accordingly
(PreOT, BT's or cluster's as determined in step 1).

3. If it was a BT or cluster and the BT or cluster has not
blown by this time handle per the usual OT III or NOTs
procedure to a blow.

If needed, recheck:

Is (intention/purpose) also:

(With original intention/purpose)

Yours
a (another) BT's
a (another) Cluster's

Leaving out "Yours" if already run,
Then handle as above.

This completes the handling of another being or person for a PreOT.

The above procedure can be used on any of the L Rundowns to flatten
any terminal which found on any L&N list.

THE L10 RUNDOWN INTRODUCTION

L10 is designed to handle the things a thetan uses to restrain
himself.  The person regains his ability and power to do those things
he intends to do and as a result he feels more at cause than ever
before.  L10 is an action that really releases a person's power on the
third and fourth dynamic. It takes off the stops that hold a person
back on these dynamics.

L1O will boost the individual's confront and responsibility level and
consequently raise his doingness level.

PREREQUISITES: L10 is not restricted to only those who have completed
OT III. The only prerequisites to L10 are a complete NED Drug R/D and
Expanded Grades. It may not be done in the Non-interference Zone
between Grade VI R6EW and OTIII.

Note -- All assessing is done M-6 (the L10 method of assessing a list).
You look at the PC or PreOT and ask him directly every item or
question on the list.(Tape recording 7106C12)

THE L10 RUNDOWN STEP TWO

STEP TWO: IDENTITIES

This part of the L10 Rundown consists of 37 L&N actions to be
listed per the Laws of Listing and Nulling to a BD F/N item. They are
done in the order listed. On the purpose/intention list, if you get
VVGI's BD F/N and major case cognition or valence shift, that's it on
that step. If it goes to BD F/N VGI's, not a real blow out, then run
the item R3RA quad or run recall on it or D/L for a PreOT at OT III or
above. This rundown undercuts OT III and NOTS. It breaks up a case in
a very subtle fashion. Be sure not to audit over a persistent F/N. You
may only be able to do one list each session. This blows off beings,
valences, overwhelm, confusion and increases reach vastly.

The basic L&N questions are:

Who or What (W/W) was (Item from list) ?
or
Who or What would have been (Item from list) ?
or
What past identity was (Item from list) ?
or
What past identity would have been (Item from list) ?

Use the question which communicates best to the PC or PreOT
and gives the biggest read.

ITEM LIST

Note- All assessing is done M-6 (the L10 method of assessing a list).
You look at the PC or PreOT and ask him directly every item or
question on the list.(7106C12)

DYNAMIC PROCESSING CHECKS

The following letter and Dynamic Processing Checks were
received from Jan Halpern, International Council Member.  They
are for use as zero questions.

"Dear Ron,

You mentioned in D.C. that some dynamic processing checks
would be useful.  Here are some.  They're more of a nucleus
than a really full set of questions.  I suspect there are gaps
large enough to drive tanks through which are not obvious to
me at this point.  So, it would be nice it they were added to
by somebody whose dynamic blind spots and mish-meshes are
different from mine!

THE "L" RUNDOWNS

THE L11 RUNDOWN INTRODUCTION

L11, The New Life Rundown was developed to give a person a new life.
This means it can handle that part of an individual's case which stops
him from really living.  It handles the major source of aberration
upon which attention is fixed, blasting apart that major personal
stumbling block.

The EP of L11 is a New Life.

PREREQUISITES:  Lll (formerly L9S) is not restricted to only those who
have completed OT III.  The only prerequisites to Lll are a complete
Drug R/D and Expanded Grades.  It may not be done in the
Non-interference Zone between Grade VI, R6EW and OT III.

In all the "L" Rundowns (L10, Lll, and L12), the PC or PreOT is fully
set up first with a C/S 53 and GF40 expanded if needed.

The L11 RUNDOWN STEP ONE

STEP ONE: 37R

Do the full 37R Rundown as given in C/S Series 37R.

Items from 37R Rundown L&N lists can be blown by D/L if
needed.

They can also be checked for "Yours", "a BT'S, "A cluster's"
for PreOT's and handled appropriately.

THE "L" RUNDOWNS

THE L11 RUNDOWN STEP TWO

STEP TWO: JUSTIFICATION

1. Have PC or PreOT read the HCOB entitled "JUSTIFICATION".

2. 2 w/c "How have you justified your overts?"
(Be sure question reads)

3. L&N "What evil purpose have you had?"to BD F/N item.

Take the LFBD F/N item found and for a PC use:

Locate an incident that contains the
evil purpose

For example:

"to dumbfound others"

For a PC use:

Locate an incident that contains the evil purpose
to dumbfound others.

Be sure it is an evil intention or purpose.
Run the item quad R3RA to full erasure.
For a PreOT:
Find out if the evil purpose is:

1.YOURS
2.A BODY THETANS
3.A CLUSTERS

If YOURS reads, have PreOT:

Locate an incident that contains the evil
purpose to ____________

D/L earlier D/L to basic if needed.
Pick up other flows if they read and also D/L
earlier D/L to basic.

If BT reads, have PreOT:

1. Locate BT's position relative to the body
(should be reading).

2.  Ask it, "Is (intention) yours?"  If yes and
no F/N, "Recall a time when you had the
intention to (______________________)" (back to the
first time).

3.  If answer is "no" and BT protests, check
false.  The false question being, "Did
anyone ever say you had the intention to
( ______________ ) when you really didn't?"

Then blow with OT III or NOTS procedure
if not blown on recalls.

Alternate Handling

l. Assess the Incident list from the OT or NOTS
Drug Rundown to determine what type of incident
caused the individual to have that intention.
2. D/L earlier D/L to basic or blow the incident
found.
3. If needed, finish up with OT III or NOTS procedure
depending on where the PreOT is on the Grade Chart.

If Cluster reads, have PreOT:

1. Locate Cluster's position relative to the body.
(should be reading)
2. Assess the Incident list from the OT or NOTS
Drug Rundown to find out what type of mutual
incident caused the cluster to be formed.
3. D/L earlier D/L to basic, break up or blow of
cluster.
4. Find out if there are any individuals left
over from cluster and if there are, handle
with OT III or NOTS procedure depending on
where PreOT is on the Grade Chart.

End off this step on a major case change, valence shift and/or
ability gained with VVGI's Floating TA and Cognition.

STEP FOUR: L11 WANTS HANDLED RUNDOWN (Basic Aberration Rundown)

An aberrativc or "wants handled" subject is prepchecked.
The session is ended when the prepcheck is complete.

Every PC or PreOT answer is turned into a listing question on a separate sheet.
For example, "On or concerning school, has anything been suppressed?".

The L&N question would be: "Who or What would suppress how hard it is to
study?"

See TECHNICAL BULLETIN 29 JULY 1984, ISSUE III
L RUNDOWN TERMINAL PROCEDURE, for procedure to handle a terminal.

Steps above are repeated until all "wants handled" items are complete.

Notes of how to do this step:

Prep check area of interest
L & N (see example above)
4-way O/Ws on terminal found
intention of the terminal
blow it hy D/L
if it was his intention: "what progress have you made?"
if specific being, D/L first encounter.

THE L12 RUNDOWN INTRODUCTION

The intention behind L12 is to make a fully extroverted and stable
thetan. This rundown aims at handling very basic and specific aspects
of a person's beingness.  Here are those case things which tend to
capture part of the person's attention so he has much less of it to
put on life and doingness.

The person experiences certainty and unshakability as a being with the
ability to handle his own universe.

PREREQUISITES:  L12 is not restricted to only those who have completed
OT III.  The only prerequisites to L12 are a complete Drug R/D and
Expanded Grades.  It may not be done in the Non-interference Zone
between Grade VI, R6EW and OT III.

In all the "L" Rundown' (L10, Lll, and L12) the PC or PreOT is fully
set up first with a C/S 53 and GF40 expanded if needed.

STEP ONE: PRESSURES AND MASSES

1. Have PC or PreOT locate a pressure area that reads on the
meter.

2. Get the location of the pressure area relative to the body.

3. Have the PC or PreOT put and hold his/her attention an the
pressure area.

4. Assess the "L12 Type of Incident" list to the first
reading item and indicate this to the PC/PreOT.

5. Date to blow/Locate to blow the incident found.

6. Find out if completely blown, and if not, repeat 4 and 5
until pressure area is completely blown.

Note- If OTIII PreOT, complete any remaining BTs with
OTIII procedure. If NOTS PreOT, complete any remaining
BTs with NOTS procedure.

THE L12 RUNDOWN STEP FOUR

STEP FOUR: PTS BEAM HANDLING
METHOD ONE:

l. Ask PC/PreOT, "Do you have any beams stuck to yourself or
the body?"

2. If yes, have him locate a reading beam stuck to himself or
the body.

3. Find out who put it there.

4. D/L the incident when it was put there.

5. Repeat until "no more beams".

6. Repeat above procedure with "field distortions".

7. Repeat until no more "field distortions".

METHOD TWO:

1. PC/PreOT is shown this definition of a BEAM:
"A flow of electricity with teeth and edges."

The definition is illustrated with a picture of a
BODY being beamed by another person, the beam being
hooked into the body by teeth like a circular saw
blade or fish hooks. The thetan is at effect of the
beamed body; no decision, overt, or involvement of
his own being responsible for the effect.
(This data must be kept confidential, as it could
serve to invalidate the wonderful control mechanism
that is necessary to manipulate PC/PreOT thoughts
and behavior. For example, "You must have pulled it
in" or "What was your overt prior to me annoying
you?")

2. A list of terminals is gotten. It must 1nclude all 2D
terminals, friends, enemies, with special emphasis on earlier allies.

3. In order of size of read, ask:

"Did___________________________beam your body?" If yes,

D/L the incident when it was put there.
If this doesn't blow it, one could say to the PC/PreOT,
"Do what you have to do to nullify it."

PC/PreOT blunts the teeth, mocks up water on
it, burns it, zips out his end and lets it fly
back to the owner, etc. This is a last resort as
the D/L is much more clean and neat.

These beams will still be attached as a control mechanism even
if the enemy, family member or 2D is long physically gone.

4. Next take up FIELD DISTORTIONS by asking,

"Do you have any field distortions"

5. Assess the TYPE OF INCIDENT list to find our what
caused it.

6. D/L the incident found to a blow of the field distortion.

THE L12 RUNDOWN STEP FIVE

STEP FIVE:  OCA TRAIT HANDLING

1.  Go over the PC/PreOT's OCA.

2.  Take each negative area trait and make up a listing
question.  For example:  "critical"

The basic L&N questions are:

Who or What (W/W) was  (Item from OCA)?

W/W would have been  (Item from OCA)?

or

What past identity was  (Item from OCA)?

or

What past identity would have been  (Item from OCA)?

Use the question which communicates best to the PC or PreOT
and gives the biggest read.

Clear the L&N question with the word to be used such as:
W/W was critical?  LF
List and Null to one item such as:
a cranky maid LFBD F/N

See TECHNICAL BULLETIN 29 JULY 1984 ISSUE III L RUNDOWN
TERMINAL PROCEDURE for procedure to handle a terminal.

Take the next negative point trait off the OCA list
and repeat procedure.

End off this step on a major case change, valence shift
and/or ability gained with VVGI's Floating TA and Cognition.

THE L12 RUNDOWN STEP SIX

STEP SIX:  IDENTITY ASSESSMENT LIST

Assess the subject of the group M6.  The word is called or
shouted very accusatively with the auditor looking directly into the
PC's eyes.  The meter read is noted.  This word is called to
restimulate the group; then the other items of the group are asked as
questions M5.  The identities of one group are handled in order of
size of read.  Then continue on with the next group, etc. When the
whole list is handled, reassess from the beginning and handle each
item as it comes up, taking slowed or checked F/N's as reads.  Handleto
 persistent F/N on the whole list.  Check at the end of each group
if any beingness that was restimulated by the accusative identity was
not on the list.

Handle each identity with the same technique as is used on the
Ll2 LX Rundown.  See TECHNICAL BULLETIN 29 July 1984 ISSUE III L

THE L10 RUNDOWN INTRODUCTION

L10 is designed to handle the things a thetan uses to restrain
himself.  The person regains his ability and power to do those things
he intends to do and as a result he feels more at cause than ever
before.  L10 is an action that really releases a person's power on the
third and fourth dynamic. It takes off the stops that hold a person
back on these dynamics.

L1O will boost the individual's confront and responsibility level and
consequently raise his doingness level.

PREREQUISITES: L10 is not restricted to only those who have completed
OT III. The only prerequisites to L10 are a complete NED Drug R/D and
Expanded Grades. It may not be done in the Non-interference Zone
between Grade VI R6EW and OTIII.

Note -- All assessing is done M-6 (the L10 method of assessing a list).
You look at the PC or PreOT and ask him directly every item or
question on the list.(Tape recording 7106C12)
