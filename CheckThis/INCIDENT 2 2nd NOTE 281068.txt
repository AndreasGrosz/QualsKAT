2nd Note
28 Oct ‘68


Incident 2


This incident is over 36 days long. Capture on other planets was weeks or month before the implant. Those in Teegeeack (Earth) were just blown up except for Loyal Officers who were (shortly before the explosion on Earth) rounded up.
Do NOT scan through the duration of 36 days. The Volcanic Explosion on Earth to the point where „the Pilot says he’s mocking it up is only a few days.
Sequence of Inc 2 for thetans on another planet:
1. 	Capture (being shot)
2. 	Freezing
3. 	Transport to Teegeeack (sometimes via a relay point)
4. 	Being placed near a volcano
5. 	Hydrogen bomb explosion in or on the volcano
6. 	Beginning Implant up to „the Pilot“.
7. 	Various picture sequences
8. 	The 7s and CC and OT II materials
9. 	36 days of picture implant which give a vast array of materials and 3 explanations for the bombing
10. 	Transport to Hawaii or Las Palmas for packaging up into clusters.
The pictures contain God, the Devil, Angels, Space Opera, Theatres, Helicopters, a constant spinning, a spinning dancer, trains and various scenes very like modern England: You name it, it’s in this implant we call in its entirety „R6“.
If he was a Loyal Officer on Teegeeack the sequence was 
1. 	Capture
2. 	#5 above on.
If one was a citizen of Teegeeack there was only #5 on.
The material given at the various „volcanoes“ was longer or shorter but dove-tailed into the same sequence of pictures. We have the whole text but it is needles.
People who feel dizzy have gotten into the spinning part.
