OT III ERRORS


Among OT III errors are:
A BT run on Inc I fails to blow.
There are three reasons:
(a) 	Auditor is trying to run a cluster with an Incident I. The right thing to do is get the character of the incident that made it a cluster, date/locate it and then run Inc Is on those left when it breaks up.
(b) 	There is an earlier Incident I on the same BT. Find it and run it. The BT has a chain of them all by himself.
(c) 	Another BT is copying the Inc I just run so it looks like it didn’t blow. Failure to ever run Inc II can also cause a bog.
An LDN OT III given by an OT III Review Auditor also handles bogged OT III preOTs.
