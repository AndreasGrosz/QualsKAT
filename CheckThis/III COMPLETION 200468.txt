IMPORTANT NOTE SECT III

III COMPLETION


It does not matter whether or not you ran Inc 1 & 2 on self.
THE END PHENOMENA OF III IS GETTING RID OF ALL BODY THETANS. This does not necessarily include self.
If you overrun III it will be any trying to get rid of more body thetans than there were or by then, having gotten rid of the others, starting in on self.
So III is complete  for purpose of overrun as above.
If you have not done Inc 1 & 2 on self when above is achieved, attest completion and then do 1 & 2 on self.
