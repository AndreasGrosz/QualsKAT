RUNNING OT III


When running OT III the Solo Auditor handles Body Thetans as he would any other pc, for the general idea is to run them standardly and not to ARC Break them. He does not scan through anything in order to find body thetans.
When a Solo Auditor can find no more BTs, he can attest or run a pressure area down and handle as per his running instructions.
The pre OT could be exterior and the interiorization process can be run in Review to help him through.
Here are three reasons why a pre OT might have trouble whilst running BTs on Incident II:
1. It is the wrong area.
2. It is not the volcano of the BT being run.
3. It is not an Incident II but another incident of a different date.
Check 1 and 2 if you are having any difficulty in running Incident II and handle by locating the correct area or finding the volcano of the BT being run.
If it is not a II simply check for the date and if different, run it.
