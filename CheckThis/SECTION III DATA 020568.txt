SECRET

Section III Data


When a pc, beginning Sect III OT can „find no body Qns“, all data to date indicate they are below his awareness level.
Getting charge off re the Milazzo approach as in an April ‘68 HCOB is the answer. Carried on long enough with Green Green, full Green Form, and the Milazzo addition, body Qns show up and can be run.
As such a pc is low on confront, the task of all this is best done by a good auditor.
The rule that reality is increased in proportion to the charge gotten off is the firm rule. Get charge off the case by repeated use of Green Green Form – (the repeat it over again is inferred in the title Green Green Form).

Overruns

A pc who still has body Qns can register wildly on „Overrun“ on Section III without being overrun.
It is a body Qn that has been overrun. This should be checked.
A pc on whom anything and everything wildly reads is overrun. The same phenomenon is found when an item is passed up on a list.
____________________

A pc who has had to have a Milazzo also has all grades out on self. These must now be run 0 to IV etc.
