Loyal Officer

”The Galactic Confederation was very old. It had endured for thousands and thousands of years. It had been happy, prosperous and peaceful.
”The planets were politically democratic. The people elected their own governors and civil officials and the entire Galaxy was governed by the Congress of Loyal Officers of the People. These were trained men, skilled in political and martial arts. When they were graduated from their academy they stood for election to the Congress and those chosen loyally served the people.
”There was also an executive branch headed by the Supreme Ruler, a man also elected by the people and responsible for the day to day running of the Confederation but under the laws and appropriations of Congress.” (Excerpt of „Revolts in the Stars“ by LRH)
