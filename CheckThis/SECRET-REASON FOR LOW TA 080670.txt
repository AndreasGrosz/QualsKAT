THE REASON FOR LOW TA

The reason for low TA is unflat OT III phenomena.
If a person has had a low TA in lower grades (see HCOB 8 June, 70, Issue 1) the keynote is take it very easy as auditor and C/S. This applies also to any auditing given on upper OT Levels.
That a Pc’s TA goes below 2.0 is a certain indicator of unflat OT III. He’s still got some.
When a person cannot handle OT III he is too much at effect. He cannot project his intention. And so can’t run OT III.
The new OT I and OT II, particularly OT II, are designed to increase a pc’s ability to project his intention to others. If he can’t, they overwhelm him and you get low TA or ”none on III”. Harsh, overbearing auditing or life incidents have to occur, apparently to drive the TA down.
Overts, disagreements expressed as obsessive agreement and other lower level matters are at the bottom of this in any being.
But any ”case of low TA” I have ever found has been:
(1) Overwhelmed in life; 
(2) Unable to project intention; 
(3) Physically inactive; 
(4) Loaded with BTs; 
(5) Tends to go out of valence easily.
In all this (4) is the important point.
The cure is given in HCOB 8 June, 70, Issue 1, and the only thing that this HCOB, Issue II, adds is that it IS (4) above.
Endless OT III and Low TA are alike – inability to project intention, pc at effect.
Remedy by lightly causing pc to come to cause, to be able to project his intention and thus flatten OT III.
That will complete and finish off low TA.
