CLUSTERS


Clusters can exert a fantastic pressure on the body, cause heart palpitation, lung troubles and null off whole body areas.
By working the Milazzo over and over and over, even the most resistive cluster will eventually disperse.
When one is partially reduced, pressure is reduced below a danger point.
The numbers involved are sometimes very large.
Relief is accomplished in ratio to the number of Inc Is run fully or by dispersal and blow. Both phenomena occur.
The rule, the increase in reality is proportional to the amount of charge gotten off holds true. Any charge off tends in this direction. Mutual Incidents and Inc Is are the important charges.
This can take much longer than you would think on some cases.
Electric shocks (not just the „treatment“ kind) are a prime source of clusters. This is why electric shock should never be used in „therapy“.
Cases can go OT and while still in or around the body, can go downscale from the body having been hit by a new cluster.
Thetans that hit a body and seem powerful are in fact clusters.
When a case can’t seem to erase things, the reason for it is clusters which then have to be handled as per the Milazzo.
Cases in an extreme condition should be audited out of by a Class VIII. It can be done solo, however. It just takes much longer. There is a liability in doing it solo in that a cluster not recognized as such won’t erase and the solo auditor might not know enough to use the Milazzo approach. I repeat however, it can be done solo if the solo auditor uses the Milazzo.
