OT 
SECTION ONE

21 JULY 68


This section is done outside in the open air. It is done off a meter. But TA should be taken before and after doing the section. If the TA has gone high, a step has been (a) not flattened or (b) overrun. Find out on a meter which it is. Handle it.
It is not the intention of this section to exeriorise anyone but if it happens don’t worry about it or fool around with the fact.
An auditing report is due for each session which can be one or more of these drills.
A great many phenomena (strange things) can happen while doing these drill if they are done honestly.
Don’t do a session on these drills if you have an ARC br, a WH, a PTP, are PTS or are ill. Instead go to Review first. Do these (and any others) OT Section sessions with rudiments in.
If one of these drills turns on a somatic, the drill should turn it off if continued.

	GOOD LUCK
