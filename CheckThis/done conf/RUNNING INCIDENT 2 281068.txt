3rd Note
28 Oct


Running Incident 2


Anything a preOT gets into on Inc 2 is destimulated by (a) Running „Capture to Pilot“ or „Explosion to Pilot“ (b) then running the Inc 1s of the beings who has Inc 2 in restimulation.
Also, a Class VIII in Review can find and run the OVERT  SEQUENCE of engrams that makes the motivat (Inc 2 & Inc 1 are motivators) key-in so hard.
Either of these actions ((a) & (b) or finding the overt sequence of implant someone) will stop any serious „spin“ a preOT gets into in doing Incidents 1 and 2 in OT III.
