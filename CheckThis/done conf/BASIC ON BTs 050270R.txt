THE BASIC ON BTs


I’ve isolated a way a thetan comes to be stuck to another thetan. This gives the basis of clusters and having BTs.
The cycle is this: A thetan collides with another. That one makes a picture of being collided with. Other BTs get stuck to the picture.
The moment of actual contact of thetans was brief but the picture (containing a stop or withdraw) tends to be permanent.
Thetans then get the idea they can be permanently stuck as they see pictures of it happening.
Thus we get the concept of a “black theta body”. This would be actual BTs stuck to a thetan plus pictures of BTs stuck to a thetan.
An answer to all this is to find the first picture a thetan made of contacting another thetan.
If not at once available the earliest instance of a thetan contacting (colliding, running into, attacking) another thetan could be achieved by Date/Locating times when one was being suddenly hit with clusters, or strange pains. (Ref: HCOB 15 Nov 78, DATING AND LOCATING.)
The idea is to find and blow the first picture one made of another thetan.
This opens another way to “blow off” BTs – Date /Locate on a BT the first picture the BT ever made of another thetan.
