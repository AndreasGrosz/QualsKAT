As a matter of data, the only trouble really in a OT III run is running an Inc II on one thetan and an incident I on another, thinking it was the first one. A preOT can free wheel into R6 if you run only an Inc II. You can stop the free wheel at once by running Inc I off the same thetan you ran the Inc II on that started a free wheel.
Free wheel means that the pc goes on automatic continuous run. Inc II is R6 75 million years ago. Inc I is about 4 quadrillion years ago. Both, all thetans on this planet and 21 nearby stars have in common. All thetans in the Universe have Inc I. Only those in this Old Confederation have Inc II (R6). 
All CC and OT II materials are in R6, 75 million years ago. These are followed by 36 days worth of motion pictures – god devil, space opera, trains, cars, helicopters, crashes, stage etc. This R6 is 75 million years ago and this planet and confederation.
If the volcano bit is run as per OT III directions but the Inc I is not run on same thetan, R6 begins to run off on automatic, the being can’t sleep for days, the body dies. That’s the way it was designed.
