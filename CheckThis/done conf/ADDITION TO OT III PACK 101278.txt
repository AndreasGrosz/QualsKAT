ADDITION TO OT III PACK


The following is added to the OT III pack as Pre OTs on Solo OT III need this data.


EARLIER INCIDENT I

The most common difficulty you get into with a BT that doesn’t blow is there was an earlier Incident I, some have several earlier Incident I’s. The question “An earlier Incident I?” will read if there is. When you get down to the first incident I you are liable to jump from one BT to another, if you keep asking for an earlier.


EARLIER UNIVERSE

There were several universes earlier than this one. If “earlier incident I?” doesn’t work, then its “earlier universe?”—the BT recognizes there was an earlier universe—the BT will spot this and blow. It is unnecessary to run the incident that occurred in the earlier universe, because it will blow without it.
(Caution: There is an implant which miscounts the number of earlier universes, making it seem there were far more than there were).
