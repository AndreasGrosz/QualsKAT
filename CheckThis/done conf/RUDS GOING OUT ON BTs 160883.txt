RUDS GOING OUT ON BTs

(Ref: 	HCOB 15 Aug 83	Flying Ruds on Solo OT III and Above
HCOB 15 Aug 78	Rudiments, Definition and Patter
HCOB 23 Aug 71	C/S Series 1 Auditors Rights)

Smooth auditing is only possible when the rudiments are in. This applies at all levels, whether the level is audited by another or done Solo. It applies equally to PreOTs and BTs. And, just as you would never start a session with any out ruds on yourself or any BT, so must you be able to recognize and handle any ruds that go out while the session is in progress.
Rudiments do go out on BTs. The following list of indicators of out ruds will enable a Solo OT III auditor to spot out ruds when they occur and pinpoint the specific cause in each case. (The list is based on that given in C/S Series 1, Auditors Rights, and presented here as it applies to Solo OT III or above.)


BT critical
=
W/H from auditor


BT antagonistic
=
BPC in session


No TA
=
Problem


BT sad
=
ARC Break


Soaring TA
=
Overrun or protest; (also more than one BT being run in error or it’s a Cluster.)


Auditor tired
=
No sleep or incomplete Inc I’s


Auditor dope off
=
By-passed F/N or not enough sleep


Auditor no interest
=
Out ruds on BTs


A solo auditor who runs into trouble with a BT and who isn’t sure of what it is will be smart to end off the session quickly, write down the full observation and get it to the C/S.
The Solo auditor who knows the scale given above, knows what he is looking at (and knows what C/S the Case Supervisor would order) handles it promptly.


BT critical
=
W/H = pull the W/H

BT antagonistic
=
BPC = assess proper list (such as L1C) and handle

No TA (or case gain)
=
Problem = locate the problem and handle

BT sad
=
ARC Break = locate and handle, itsa earlier itsa

Soaring TA
=
O/R or Protest (Also more than one BT being run in error or it’s a Cluster) = find which and handle. (Run-ning more than the one intended comes from too WIDE an intention.)

Auditor tired
=
no sleep or incomplete Inc I’s = check which it is and handle

Auditor dope off
=
lack of sleep or BP F/N = check on sleep or rehab F/N

Auditor no interest
=
out ruds on BTs = put in ruds.

The stable datum to remember is that it is a gross auditing error for a solo auditor to continue auditing over out ruds whether his own, a BT’s or a cluster’s.
And if at start of session you are not F/Ning with VGIs, the remedy is to get those ruds in.
You will find it makes all the difference in the smoothness of your solo sessions.
