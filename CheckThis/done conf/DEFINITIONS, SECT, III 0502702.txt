DEFINITIONS, SECT, III


For the purpose of clarity, by BODY THETAN is meant a thetan who is stuck to another thetan or body but is not in control.
A THETAN is, of course, a Scientology word using the Greek “Theta” which was the Greek symbol for thought or life.
An individual being such as a man is a thetan, he is not a body and he does not think because he has no brain.
A CLUSTER is a group of body thetans crushed or held together by some mutual bad experience.
