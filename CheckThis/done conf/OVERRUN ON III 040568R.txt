OVERRUN ON III


The only way you can get a read on ”overrun on III” is to have accidentally run Inc II out on a BT who did not then get run on Inc I and blow, and then later ”run it out again” on the same thetan or make a similar blunder.
Example: One flattens Inc II by several passes on a body thetan. This body thetan for some reason, (mostly because Inc I was then not run) does not fly off. Then, not noticing, one again finds the same thetan and once more seeks to run Incident II. One then gets, in answer to the question ”overrun on III?” a lot of reads and other overrun phenomena.
The remedy is to find out WHO was overrun and get the charge off by that action.
One then runs Incident I on that thetan or in any event by getting off the charge of ”overrun”, letting the thetan depart.
Just because one’s meter reads ”overrun on III” is no reason to attest. Find out WHO was. It’s almost always a body thetan.
