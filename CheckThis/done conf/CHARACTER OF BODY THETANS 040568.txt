CHARACTER OF BODY THETANS


Body thetans are just thetans. When you get rid of one he goes off and possibly squares around, picks up a body or admires daisies. He is in fact a sort of cleared being. He cannot fail to eventually, if not at once, regain many abilities. Many have been asleep for the last 75 million years.
A body thetan responds to any process any thetan responds to.
Some body thetans are suppressive. A suppressive is Out of Valence in R6. He is IN valence in Inc I almost always.
One can’t run a human being on these two incidents since human beings are composites and would not be able to run the lot. Aside from that non-clears are away below an awareness required to even find these incidents.
Huge amounts of charge have already been removed from the case and the body thetans by Clearing and OT 1 and OT 2 to say nothing of engrams and lower grades.
Awareness is proportional to the charge removed from the case.
All though a human being is a composite being there is only one I (that is you) who runs things.
Body thetans just hold one back.
You will continue to be you. You, inside, can of course separate out body thetans and so solo auditing is the answer.
How good do you have to be to run body thetans off? Well, if you didn’t skimp your grades, clearing and OT 2 particularly, you should be able to command body thetans easily.
