SECRET

CLUSTER FORMATION

CUMULATIVE

(Reference: HCOB 15 Nov 78 DATING AND LOCATING.)

In doing “a cluster” one is likely to find it is made up of other earlier clusters. This is called a “cumulative cluster ”.
A CLUSTER is a group of body thetans crushed or held together by some mutual bad experience.
A CUMULATIVE CLUSTER is a group of two or more clusters crushed or held together by some mutual bad experience.
A cumulative cluster looks like this: (the shapes are for illustration only)

A.


3 clusters impacted together (driven or wedged tightly together) by: 1898 – Impact Horse Accident.


B.

The type of mutual incident is first established (in this case, an impact). When the 1898 incident is then Date/Located, one cluster (the square part) blows. (On the meter you get a LF or BD and F/N when the incident is dated to blow, and a LF or BD and F/N when located to blow.)

C.


The remainder consists of 2 clusters, held together by an earlier cluster making incident.

D.


Type of earlier mutual incident is established, by meter read, as Electric shock. When the incident is Date/Located (93 million years ago on Planet X – or more exact location) another cluster blows.

E.


One cluster, the earliest portion of the cumulative cluster, now remains.

F.


The type of mutual incident is established as an implant. This is Date/Located (72 Trillion years ago, in area Y of Planet Z) and the final cluster blows.
Note: In Date/Locating you get an F/N on Dating (blow) and an F/N on Locating (blow). Each F/Ns.



HANDLING ANY SINGLE BTs REMAINING FROM A CLUSTER

AA.

Single BTs remaining from a cumulative cluster.


BB.

You must check by meter read for any BT remaining from a cluster. If there is one, locate the BT and handle him to blow with Inc II and Inc I. The needle will F/N as he blows off.
IMPORTANT NOTE: If one of the incidents you ran on the cumulative cluster happened to be an Inc II, you would now run Inc I on any remaining BTs to avoid overrunning Inc II.
CC.


Check to see if another BT remains from the cluster and if so handle the BT to blow per step BB above.


When any remaining BTs have been handled to blow, you can check for and handle copies, as needed.
______________

Clusters or cumulative clusters are handled by finding the type of incident which made the cluster (the correct type will read on the meter); then meter dating to blow and locating to blow.
Clusters can occur at Inc II and Inc I, so either could be on a cumulative chain.
They can also occur at 1 to 1½  Quadrillion which is the date (this can be dated exactly) of the Clearing Course materials. (Ref: HCOB 14 August 1983, CC IMPLANT.)
Clusters can occur at random dates for different reasons.
_______________

The correct procedure for Date/Locating a cluster or cumulative cluster is:

(a) 	Find by meter read the type of incident that made it into a cluster.
(b) 	Date the point when it became a cluster to blow. (Ref: HCOB 15 Nov 78, DATING AND LOCATING.)
(c) 	Locate the place where it became a cluster to blow. (Ref: HCOB 15 Nov 78, DATING AND LOCATING.)
(d) 	Handle any remaining single BTs to blow.
(e) 	Handle copies.

A cumulative cluster is handled by Date/Locating the latest mutual incident first, then the next earlier mutual incident, and so on down to the basic (earliest) mutual incident for that cluster. (Blows will occur as you go down the cumulative cluster chain, as shown in the diagrams.) Then handle any remaining single BTs. Handle copies.
Clusters and cumulative clusters are not difficult to handle provided you follow the method and steps for handling given above.
With spot on metering and the tech of Date/Locating correctly applied you will have no problem with it.
Good luck!
