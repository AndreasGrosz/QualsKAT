HANDLING CORRECTION LISTS ON OTs


When you get a read on a correction list on a Pre-OT who is on OT III or above, you should find out from what area it is reading. i.e. find the position in relation to the body, of the BT or cluster on whom that correction list question read.
Otherwise, the reading correction list line gets assigned to all areas, when it only applied to one. This creates BPC as it gives the rest a wrong item or wrong indication, and it makes the reading question appear to be a generality, when in fact it only applied to one BT or cluster.
By finding the BT or cluster that the read applied to, the auditor then clears the read on that BT or cluster. And then takes any additional steps to get it to blow and blow it.
The above does not apply to cases below OT III and must never be mentioned to such a case.
There is a tendency of an auditor trained on general correction lists to simply clear the read without finding where it is coming from and as this omission can jam up a case who is on OT III or on NOTs, such auditors when doing NOTs or actions on Pre-OTs OT III or above must learn to handle correction lists in this way. It can mean the difference between failure and success.
